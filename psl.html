                    <p>Digital by default has been a goal for some time, but with the pace of change in the open source community, now is perhaps the time to realise the potential of delivering streamlined services in a <span class="muted">better, faster, simpler</span> way.</p>

                    <h3>Use open source to deliver online services</h3>
                    <p>Typical government procured solutions to service delivery have relied on start from scratch, custom designed, all in one packages. The outcome is often slow to implement, hard to integrate with other systems and difficult to modify as needs changes.</p>
                    <p>So why not embrace the approach taken by the open source community? After all:</p>
                    <ul><li>Open source provides starter apps to let you hit the ground running with millions hosted on <a href="http://government.github.com" >github</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a> and <a href="http://data.gov.uk/linked-data">linked data</a> are making it easier to integrate software</li>
                    <li>If it's not exactly what you want you can customise to your needs, whenever you need</li></ul>

                    <p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com" >Mapbox</a> for GIS. <a href="http://www.shopify.com" >Shopify</a> for a truly transactional online presence. <a href="http://github.com" >Github</a> for document storage. These are just examples, but by rethinking the way we approach service delivery there is the potential to deliver <span class="muted">better, faster, simpler,</span> for less.</p>

 <p>The proposal is to develop a proof of concept, local government online services suite, using open source and cloud hosting software. </p>

                    <h3>More for less</h3>
                    <p>If this proposal delivers a proof of concept, it offers the opportunity to radically challenge the current way we think about how public sector provides its services. This is not just in technical terms. By lowering the barriers to digital by default, it promises to allow government to redesign business processes and become more responsive to changing demands.</p>
                    <p>The impact on residents could be greater still. Offering <span class="muted">better, faster, simpler</span> promises to make interactions with government easy.</p>

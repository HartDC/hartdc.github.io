{"r":[4,3,5,2,1],"q1":"I understand the need to expand housing options and support that - but the key question is where that happens in the region. What I see as a local resident is over development of Fleet compared to surrounding areas. Major strain already applied to local services and infrastructure (doctors, schools, roads, rail etc) - some of which are at or near breaking point in Fleet.My understanding is council have approved Edenbrook Village which is already another large development in Fleet. Hopefully this is being considered as part of this. I know Berkeley also have another application for a further site just down Hitches Lane.Other areas have better capacity to absorb expansion in a sustainable manner - I think the burden should be shared around the other surrounding areas. Some of the proposed sites in Fleet are very close to the flood plain which is a risk given increasing occurrences of 'rare' weather events such as flooding etc. Having seen the area around the country park at the turn of the year, even with flood modelling and the use of detenion basins etc I think it would be risky for development to continue in the Hitches Lane / Church Crookham area. This area also boasts several rare forms of wildlife that have already been disturbed by currently approved sites - is it fair to continue this disruption?","q2":"Yes","q2a":"I think it's right that the commitment to housing is shared - by having some new housing in even the smallest areas it promotes diversity and integration.","q3":"-","q4":"Yes","q4a":"Whilst I understand that developers want good economies of scale and so want large sites to develop hundreds of houses, I think we should be considering areas where we have unused buildings that could be repurposed too. Developers ALWAYS make huge profits regardless of the price paid for land and deals done on 106 agreements etc. I think it's time for the region to take a stronger stance ie welcome developers to develop the land but only the land that we want developed. Feel free to check the theory here - Berekely Homes recorded profits this year - in no small part down to Edenbrook I am sure!","q5":"Alongside the need for new homes I am sure the council is considering the need for supporting services and infrastructure (roads, schools, doctors etc). It would be great to demostrate the thinking on this alongside the housing strategy ie there is little diaglogue with (worried) residents about how all this developement can be accomodated and we can all still move around the roads, get a doctors appointment and get our children into local schools.The housing quota required for the region is clearly a difficult aim to achieve. I think the most democratic way to deal with the problem is now to share the development around the region (putting a focus on the areas which have not be as heavily developed in recent years). This will be a difficult decision for residents to accept but in terms of the logic as to why the council would take this approach it seems the fairest way to proceed to me - and I think a lot of people would ultimately recognise that. I fear however that the council may roll over here - putting all the development in one area - thus angering one set of people rather the whole region (I really hope not).","i":2},

Option 4 is too long term to meet our immediate needs however the time is fast approaching when it becomes wholly unavoidable.Options 1 & 3 are compatible and am not unduly concerned about employment sites becoming displaced after all these can always be repositioned alongside the SPA (provided planning consent contains a clear condition excluding guard dogs!) - only residential properties are restricted by SPA.Option 2 makes most sense in the short term but am concerned at likely availability of school places, GP surgeries, local community centres, etc.","i":3},

You planners are just making the housing crisis worse! Who needs 5 bedrooms?? Hook is now a small town which is In Danger of joining Basingstoke to the west and Hartley Witney to the east.","q3":"The business park/industrial sites in Hook Fleet have many premises which have never been rented. Developers should be forced to develop housing if they can't rent business premises within a given period as there is clearly no requirement for it. It would ensure that greedy developers are penalised for wasting space and that they do their research properly and ensure that there is a market for what they are building. Planners and developers are the people who gave caused this issues by approving every plan submitted without any thought for the impact on the local housing stock.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"Brown field sites, unrelated business/retail premises. Build flats and apartments. Build houses over a number of floors or with cellars. Save our country side. Listen to the residents. They know best about their area. It is much easier to accept 20 new dwellings rather than 500. Everyone should bear the new development not just a single area. Eventually you will destroy whole areas by building huge numbers of new houses. Holt Farm is a case in point. It floods when it rains and there is barely the space to drive a car through the estate. The houses are huge and overpriced. It's hardly the kind of place young couples on an average salary can afford.","q5":"All new business premises must have underground car parking to preserve as much green space as possible. In Germany, houses have under house car parks and cellars to save space. It just needs a bit of innovative thinking by architects and planners.

Of equal importance in my eyes is to ensure the developers do not price local people out of the market (see: 2 bedroom houses in Odiham marketed at £500k by Linden homes) and that a range of housing is offered that isn't just fulfilling the developers' wish to maximise revenue (4-5 bedroom houses at £800k+) and fulfilling the social housing requirements (2-3 bedroom). In other words I think it is vital that Hart plan the expansion with some tight guidelines, and require developers to fulfill it within the conditions and criteria that will most benefit Hart.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"Small scale housing expansion in the smallest villages and hamlets would give opportunity for 'self build' that is lacking in Hart at present.

There are many sites in Hart which have been 'sat on' by developers for financial reasons (eg recent application 14/01704/MAJOR) for many years, but which could have been opened up for individual families to develop new housing stock. Perhaps developers could be encouraged to work with buyers on building, without the cookie cutter estate feel. - Strategies to address some of the 'blocks' in the market e.g. older couples are not moving from 'family' homes because there are few quality opportunities for them to downsize while retaining quality of life. Large and mid size family homes are therefore in short supply.

The large number of commuters means they would end up driving to access transport.A large number of homes within walking distance (~1 mile) of Winchfield station would be very attractive to London commuters and generate little extra traffic. A supermarket at the centre of the development would also help reduce the impact on Hook/Fleet traffic. Existing facilities (surgeries, post offices, schools, etc...) would also be within 5 minutes drive or train ride and so could be shared/expanded (cheaper than building new).Firms should be attracted to use the empty Hook/Fleet office space if there are a number of new younger residents a few minutes away by rail.Of course existing Winchfield residents will go ballistic...","q4":"Don't know","q4a":"-","q5":"Maybe a little off topic but I could have a rant about the quality of recent developments that have been signed off.Main issue is incredibly cramped layouts with insufficient parking space and token, synthetic open/play areas.Anyone who has visited these developments once populated will know they resemble used car lots, with cars strewn across every pavement and road.

These are vital pieces of infrastructure to support a new settlement and relieve the stress on existing developed urban areas where further infrastructure development to support additional growth is not possible, or will result in significant stress on existing infrastructure.3.2.The scale of the new development should be such that it could support its own educational demands at all levels of education (including secondary), potentially a minimum of 5,000, and conceivably 8,000 homes.3.3.It should be large enough to support its own medical centre.3.4.It should be planned with local employment opportunities built into the development to attract inward investment into the area.3.5.The development should be capable, with phasing, of meeting not only the current planning period demand, but future demands as well.3.6.A large scale development within the SPA control zone should be developed as a 'garden town' melding the housing and commercial development within the SANG land to form a green, environmentally friendly township.3.7.Any existing settlements within the designated new town area should be sensitively treated within the overall conceptual design.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"4.1.It is most likely that a combination of options will be necessary to ensure that HDC can maintain/achieve a 5 year housing supply through the development period.4.2.It is inevitable that the planning of a new garden town will take some time to bring the new development to construction, but if this is elected as a key strategy then the gestation period needs to be significantly reduced from the 10 years indicated in the documentation.4.3.10 years to commencement will negate this as a strategy within the current planning period. Paragraph 3.1 of the Cabinet Briefing Paper states that the objectively assessed housing need is 7,534 dwellings or 359 per annum for the plan period to 2032. Allowing for completions and sites already in supply since the start of the period in 2011 a further 4,018 homes are required.4.4.This means that in the first two and half years of the Plan Period the equivalent of 9.8 years of housing supply ((7534-4018)/359) is already accounted for, but the problem lies in maintaining the 5 (or 6) year housing supply on a rolling basis.4.5.It is essential a new town makes a positive contribution to housing numbers within the plan period. If the project is 10 years in the planning it is possible another 3,590 homes should have come forward from more traditional development routes (Options 1 and 2), leaving the new development to 'mop up' a residual 428 dwellings, not making the scheme viable in this plan period.4.6.Planning of the new development should be fast tracked and phased to allow early development on identified SHLAA sites. Planning should accommodate the ease or difficulty of acquiring the land and place vital infrastructure on accessible land.4.7.This is an opportunity to build for the future and not submit to short term expedient solutions that will lead to another crisis of finding suitable development sites in 2032.","q5":"5.1.The major comments have been raised in the responses above, but one issue that was not adequately addressed in the sustainability assessment was the vital question of an improved road network to facilitate the significant out-commuting from the district. SA18 addresses 'improving the efficiency of transport networks by enhancing the proportion of travel by sustainable modes and promoting policies that reduce the need to travel.'5.2.Any likely transfer of journeys to sustainable modes of transport is going to be small compared with the significant increase in traffic generated by 7,534 new homes. Therefore the negative social, economic and environmental impact of new developments caused by increasing the stress on existing road infrastructure should be assessed for development options that rely on increasing the density of or expanding existing settlement boundaries. 5.3.This very significant issue has not been addressed in the Sustainability Assessment and would heavily weigh against Options 2 and 3.","i":192},

Option 2, therefore has got to be core to the plan.Option 4 is not feasible; 1.The Council needs a rolling 5 year supply of building land, but the published documents point out that getting option 4 up and running will take up to 10 years, by which time 2,500 units will need to have been built in Hart via one or more of the other options. 2.This would mean Option 4 would only require a further 1,500 houses, which means that all the arguments about quantities of scale, building new infrastructure etc. are not realistic.3.Whichever figure, 2,500 or 4,000 is not large enough to make be 'sustainable' in that it will not be large enough to make significant shops and leisure facilities economically viable, therefore it will lead to increased traffic.4.To be viable, a large housing estate like that proposed in Option 4 needs contiguous land. Certainly in the case of Winchfield that does not exist with at least one land owner refusing to join the others resulting in:a.A 45 acre hole in the proposed siteb.As reported in the Basingstoke Gazette, attempts to bribe that land owner, who is also an elected CouncillorOption 4, which was not only looked at in the previous strategy, but rejected by it, poses a risk to Hart that needs to be recognised:1.The Draft Strategy recognises that several other local authorities may not be able to meet their quota.2.The Draft Strategy goes on to state that under such circumstances, Harts Duty to Cooperate might mean that Hart has to take on not only its obligation but those of nearby Districts.3.In April 2014 the Deputy Prime Minster announced that the Government is seeking three sires for new Garden Cities of 15,000 homes.The net result of the above is that over the next ten years Hart will build 2,500 homes in and around the existing settlements. It will then build another 1,500 to 4,000 and might be forced by Government to build a further 11,000 and link Fleet to HookThe arguments for Option 4 include access to a railway station. This argument is inconsistent in that it could be made in favour of option 5. It is also a false argument. The presence of the line is not the question, but the capacity of the line to take more passengers. According to Network Rail's own reports this line is chronically over utilised and there are no plans to mitigate this. Indeed:*The 7.30 out of Woking to Waterloo, which this line feeds, is consistently the second most overcrowded train in the country.*People travel up the line from Fleet to Winchfield in order to get a seat on rush hour trains.Option 5. The wording and arguments on Option 5 appear to be little more than a thinly veiled attempt to dismiss this option. In fact many of the arguments that favour Option 4 could apply to Hook. It is close to the M3 at junction 5, it sits on the A30, it is close to employment areas like Basingstoke with good looks to Reading and Farnham. In addition, the Risks attributed to Option 5, especially the first 'If it involves large-scale housing delivery, this option could result in significant adverse effects to the character of the existing settlements.' If Option 4 were to be picked and dumped on Winchfield, it would be sandwidged between the M3 and the Canal and bisected by the railway. Any roads going out would almost have to go out via existing settlements such as Dogmersfield and Crookham Village. Government guidance is that there should be an assumption of 1½ cars per dwelling. That would be 6,000 cars.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"The local villages need to be able to grow as their demand increases; otherwise they will be driven out of the price range of local people.","q3":"Site 1. Hook, near junction 5 of the M3, and close to the A30 for fast road links to Basingstoke, Guildford, Farnham and Fleet. This does, however, have the problem of the railway which is already stretched to capacity up the line where it is standing room only from Farnborough.Site 2. Near Gibraltar Barracks, close to Junction 4A of the M3 and the A30. This is also close to the business parks around Farnborough Airfield, which might make it more economically sustainable.Site 3.

Given the constraints of the railway line and the canal it is difficult to see how a new town in Winchfiled could do anything other than grossly effect Dogmersfiled and Crookham Village with cars using those roads as a short cut to Aldershot, Farnham and Fleet. One could see a scenario where the land between Hitches Lane and Pale Lane was under pressure to fill the gap between 'New Fleet' and 'Old Fleet' (t would not be much good for farming by then if the surrounding farms are all built on) with more houses, with further development linking the New Town with Dogermsfield to follow.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"There is an awful lot of empty office space in and around Hart.

This is looking like the case in Hook certainly as the current 550 house plan has yet to provide any means to deal with the water and sanitation as well as factor in the growth in traffic. It is hard to see how adding a further set of housing on top of that will work either.It is also worth noting that there are no additional jobs in Hook; no one is going to come and live there to work locally - the bigger settlements like Fleet, basingstoke and reading are the places where companies will create work opportunities, not out in the country.","q5":"To be honest, I've lost faith in the system and to an extent this process.

If such a settlement were to be built it is essential that services such a doctors, dentists and schools were also part of the overall plan as well as community facilities (shops, recreational facilities, leisure facilities such as bars/pubs/restaurants, churches etc) to ensure that the new settlement is a viable community not simply a huge housing estate.","q4":"Don't know","q4a":"-","q5":"Whatever plan is adopted services and infrastructure in Hart must be looked at to ensure that they can cope with the additional demand.

Protection of birds is laudable - but preserving the character of the most historic town in Hampshire is, to me, far more important. We can easily create new reserves for ground-nesting birds but, once trashed, Odiham could never be replaced.","q2":"No","q2a":"I would like to see the rural character of our villages preserved.

Options 2 and (for most of the District) 5 would cause damaging unselective development, whilst Option 3 would penalise selected areas precisely because they had already experienced growth.

It is not fair or reasonable to just start with a clean slate in 2016 when the new plan is (hopefully) approved.Option 1 would be fine if the requirement were for 875 homes, but goes nowhere near meeting the full requirement. It could be an interim strategy though to support the more strategic Option 4.Option 2 would be acceptable if all settlements were able to accept the same proportion of expansion; however with the SPA restrictions this will not be the case, and this option could be practically the same as Option 5, with a disproportionate amount of development being pushed towards the South West of the district. The concerns outlined below for Option 5 are therefore equally valid here.Option 3 targets ALL growth at Hook, Fleet and Church Crookham. These are all areas which have already taken significant development in recent years, and continuing to target them with a disproportionate amount of development is not acceptable. This option implies that Hook is an existing town - it is not, it is a village. Hook does not have a secondary school, leisure facilities, bus services etc which you would expect in any town, and the road infrastructure is just not sufficient to support being a town. Option 4 is my preferred option. It is forward looking, and would allow planned development of the necessary infrastructure as well as just houses. It could provide an opportunity for development to 2032, and capacity even beyond that. The consolidation of development in one location would allow the associated infrastructure contributions to be focussed on that location, and really provide what is needed rather than having to be distributed across the district. This option would have to be combined with another, which I believe should be Option 1.Option 5 - if there are significant areas within Hart where development is genuinely not possible because of environmental factors such as the SPA, this should be used as a justification for reducing the housing numbers rather than an excuse to push the development all onto one small portion of the district. The concept of 1500 further new home in Hook, Odiham and a few small villages is unbelievable.

{"r":[2,3,4,1,5],"q1":"To be absolutely clear, the 4,000 houses being considered in this consultation are not the only houses in this Local Plan Period 2011-2032. Many areas have already had significant and disproportionate increases in housing in 2011-2014. Whichever option is selected as a result of this consultation, those permissions must be part of the rationale for new development.Option 1 is too small to be considered on its own and is only supplemental to other more viable choices such as Option 4.Option 2 I believe that many places in Hart would not be able to grow proportionately due to the SPA restrictions so this is little different from Option 5, which I deem totally unacceptable. I therefore do not believe that this option is a fair one.Option 3 targets ALL growth at three areas, Hook, Fleet and Church Crookham which have borne the brunt of expansion already. These areas should be allowed to settle with the existing expansion with approved housing before any significant amount more is added. If there really is a need to ONLY expand existing TOWNS, the only TOWNS should be expanded, which excludes Hook and Church Crookham which are villages, not towns. Option 4 is the strategic option and should be developed as a priority. It would allow new planned infrastructure and would have the scope to expand much, much further in future as long as it is allowed for from the start. Putting the majority of development in one location make best use of investment and developer contributions. In the interim period Option 1 can make up the short to medium term shortfall.Option 5 - using the SPA as an excuse to target housing in one concentrated area of villages is fundamentally unsound, unacceptable and quite frankly ridiculous. If the SPA means houses cannot be built in Hart then they should not be built in Hart. This option should be rejected out of hand as unfair and unsustainable.I therefore prefer Option 4, with slower growth in the interim using Option 1.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"Much is made of needing extra housing where families already live to allow developing families to stay where they are. So existing smaller settlements NEED expansion to support this demand, otherwise smaller settlements will die rather than thrive.","q3":"Winchfield is the completely obvious location.

Despite the increasing tendency of Hart councillors to 'inadvertently' refer to Hook as a town, Hook is not a town as is made clear under section 2.2 of the full Strategy and Sites Development Plan Document which includes the sentence 'Hook, Odiham, Crondall and Hartley Witney are the larger villages in the District whilst other settlements are mainly small, dispersed villages and hamlets'. As I will outline under Q4, my first choice would be a stategic urban extension close to Elvetham Heath, but the implied inclusion of Hook as a town under option 4 precludes me from selecting it as first choice. I believe that Hook should take its fair share, or even a little more, of new housing, but account should be taken of the houses for which outline planning permission is being considered or has been approved, when determining what that fair share should be. Turning Hook from a village to a town would make a significant change to the character of the village, and I would therefore consider such a re-designation as unsustainable.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"As long as new houses are in character with the existing structures in the hamlets and villages, I think there is no reason why small (i.e. not disproportionate) numbers of new houses, would fundamentally change the existing character of the hamlets and villages.

Care would however, have to be taken to maintain strategic gaps between Fleet and Winchfield and Winchfield and Hook. I think this would be a sensible approach to tackling the housing problem, but would prefer the option that I outline under Q4 below. If a new development at Winchfield was to go ahead, I feel 2,000 to 3,000 homes would be appropriate, but probably not 4,000.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"I believe there is an opportunity for a strategic urban extension to the west of Fleet which would be located both north and south of the railway to the south of Elvetham Heath. As part of this I believe that a new railway station could be located on the main line, effectively midway between Winchfield and Fleet, and funded by the developers. Not only would this give sustainable transport access to the new urban extension, but it would place a large chunk of western Fleet and most of Elvetham Heath within walking distance of the new station, reducing car use in the area. With this option, Winchfield station would retain its current rural location, and as such it would be possible to maintain a strategic gap between Fleet and Winchfield.","q5":"Whilst I am supportive of Option 1 in general, it is important that extensive 'garden grabbing' or cramming too many houses into small areas of existing villages is not allowed to occur.","i":301},

This question is null and void in my opinion. Should Option 4 be selected (which it shouldn't) then a full public enquiry is needed to determine the best place for a new settlement not just a default of Winchfield because a collection of greedy landowners want to cash in.

In particular converting the redundant office stock on Ancells Business Park to residential use may have a positive impact on overall traffic levels within the area. Ancells Business Park is on the 'right side of town' for Motorway access and to the business parks in Cove and Farnborough. With the mainline train station within walking distance additional traffic into the already congested town centre should be minimal.

There is a significantly high proportion of Retirement/Assisted Living accommodation within the town centre; this could be offset by introducing shared ownership/ affordable homes, which would almost certainly generate a lot of interest from first time buyers and younger people.Options 2 & 3 are my least favoured option, as this would concentrate development on already densely populated areas; this in my view is only delaying the inevitable. At some stage we will have to establish a new settlement to meet future demands, so let us do it now, rather than trying to squeeze additional housing onto already saturated communities. With regard to my local area, this would see further development to the west and south west of Fleet. The Edenbrook estate is still under development and the impact of this is still to be fully felt on the community. Further development in this area would mean additional traffic traversing the Fleet Town centre area trying to get to the Business Parks in Farnborough or the nearest rail or motorway links, thereby exacerbating the already dire traffic congestion in the area. Furthermore, I would not wish to see the green space between Fleet and Crookham Village eroded still further.My reason for choosing Option 5 over Options 2 & 3 are predominately based on accessibility to the major transport infrastructure while minimising the impact on already congested areas.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"I think there is justification for small developments of affordable housing in these villages and hamlets. The young people that have grown up in these areas are priced out of the market and area. I believe we need to provide positive discrimination for local people and allow the building of starter homes solely for their use. If we can encourage our young people to stay in the district, a consequence may be that they are able to provide support for their aging parents. This could have a positive impact not only on the wellbeing of the elderly, but less of a strain on the wider social services infrastructure.","q3":"I think the Winchfield area is a very good suggestion. It has seen little development and has a mainline railway station and with some changes to the road infrastructure, the new town could provide easy access to the M3 and the major road network. This development must initially meet the shortfall stated in the plan (net of Option 1 and sites with approved planning permission), but I would also hope it could meet potentially future housing needs within the Hart district, i.e. to meet requirements to say 2050!I would hope that with an appropriate long term planning strategy, we would be able to maintain the gap between existing villages/towns, e.g. Phoenix Green, Dogmersfield, Hartley Wintney, Hook and Fleet.","q4":"Don't know","q4a":"-","q5":"I was very impressed with the thoroughness and detail of the reports. However, I have one criticism. You recognise the need and in fact state the shortfall of affordable housing within the district, but you have decided not to address this within a timescale that is 'considered best practice'. I think you are doing a disservice to the young and less fortunate members of this very affluent district who would like to stay and raise their families, but are priced out of the area.","i":318},

Our objectives are to preserve our Conservation Area and to ensure that the policies and actions set out in the 2010 Crondall Conservation Area Statement are followed through. We have reviewed the above document and have the following comments:Hart has a balancing act to try and achieve development for the future, while protecting the character and identity of the varied components of the district. As such, we consider that it is appropriate for the majority of future housing development to occur where there is appropriate infrastructure and facilities that can accommodate such expansion. With this overall objective in mind, we have the following specific comments to make:Under Overview, paragraph 2.2, wrongly identifies Crondall as one of the larger villages in the District along with Yateley. Hook, Odiham, and Hartley Witney. Crondall is much smaller than these larger settlements and it does not include even a small proportion of the facilities of the larger villages. Figure 2.1 correctly identifies Crondall as a main village along with Long Sutton, South Warnborough, Ewshott, Rotherwick and so on. It should be treated as not having the infrastructure that could accommodate even modest expansion. Also, we support the recognition in paragraph 2.14 that Crondall suffers from flooding which can be a constraint on development.Option 1 - Settlement Focus. We support the general principle of housing development within the current settlement boundaries of the towns and larger villages, as new development will inevitably benefit from existing infrastructure. However, as the development boundaries have been drawn tightly around settlements, only a limited amount of housing will come forward. We particularly support the statement that recognizes the limitation of the development of open spaces within conservation areas. For reasons of clarity we would add to the end of this statement 'particularly where the open space has been identified as contributing to the character and setting to the conservation area'.Option 1 states under the sub heading How and where it could be applied that this option would not be applied to smaller villages or hamlets with which we do not agree. There may be opportunities for modest development within the build envelope of a settlement that lies within a parish boundary but outside the village envelope. Hence we suggest that the sentence which refers to the smaller settlements is either deleted or reworded to state: 'Therefore the option is intended to relate to all tiers of settlements of the hierarchy where there is satisfactory infrastructure and no adverse affect on the historical environment.'Option 2 - Dispersal strategy. It states that it would try and enable growth proportionally to each settlements' size. This is fundamentally wrong as it takes no account of any other of the settlements characteristics apart from it size. It does not take account of infrastructure, location, transport, sustainability, historical, social or environmental issues. As such, we consider that this option should be discounted all together.Option 3 - Focused Growth (strategic urban extensions). We consider that identified strategic urban extensions to tier 1 and 2 settlements would seem the most sensible way forward as it is the most sustainable, taking advantage of the existing infrastructure and facilities of the larger urban areas. It minimises the environmental impact and maximises the protection of the countryside.Option 4 - Focused growth (new settlement). We consider that this is also an option that could give an unique opportunity to plan an environmentally sustainable settlement which minimizes its impact on the surrounding area. It could, if well planned, achieve a high level of design that provides green infrastructure and transport links and therefore benefit the district as a whole. However, it is likely to take a long time before it is realized or, if ever, achieved.Option 5 - Special protection area avoidance strategy. We suggest that any option that is dictated by only one identified constraint (development should be limited within a 5km of a SPA) is not considering the wider issues and it is therefore an inappropriate way to consider future growth. This option limits development to the western area of the district where there is the least infrastructure. As such we consider that this option is inappropriate.Conclusion. We consider that your Strategy for growth should be focused on Option 3 identifying the potential expansion sites and planning the infrastructure to support them. Option 4 is well worth a detailed study to identify potential sites, but will be opposed by those living nearby.The shorter term housing needs should be accommodated using the criteria set out in Option 1, including settlements of all sizes, while recognizing the limitations there may be in historical settlements. Particular attention should be given to ensure that Conservation Areas are protected from developers looking for profitable business rather than the needs of the local community.We trust that you will consider these comments favorably, and that the new Local Plan will build on all the hard work that has been done to protect our rural environment and our Conservation Areas.

It can be likened to an island, with a small number of routes in and out which don't have the capability for expansion, bounded by the M3 and split by a main line railway, which compounds the difficulty on making road improvements. The result is a convoluted road network that precludes the efficient and sustainable provision of enough public transport to reduce use of the car on roads that, as already described, are woefully inadequate for their modern traffic flows.Crookham Village Parish Council acknowledge that the first choice of a new settlement will not deliver the necessary housing numbers in the short term, hence the support for Option 2 also.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"Crookham Village Parish Council support additional housing in the smallest villages, but emphasis should be given to providing appropriate properties for people with local connections.","q3":"Crookham Village Parish Council believe a new settlement would need to be located where there are good road and rail links, as well as easy connections to the major utilities with space and pre-planning for further expansion beyond the current plan period to avoid further crisis management at the time a new Plan is required in 2030+","q4":"No","q4a":"-","q5":"-","i":331},

I don't think there should be more than 500 houses in one new settlement, unless the brownfield site can support more, as I feel that a whole new settlement of more than this will become the focus of more development on it's outskirts, and we will eventually see developers destroying the rural centre of the district, and all villages and towns surrounding the new settlement merging into one suburban area.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"Whilst I am aware that 'Garden Grabbing' is not popular, I do think that there can be scope for development on land of larger houses which are not privately owned or maintained.

The development of a new town could therefore become a negative choice. Annual housing development would have to continue, with then in 10/20 years, an additional 4,000 + houses being built over and above the annual increase.

Small or large projects can really bring a community together and improve quality of life.This is where housing developments can help fund local community projects at the heart and centre of these villages and hamlets rather than money being invested in the outskirts on infrastructure projects which do not benefit them.","q3":"I feel this would be the worst option proposed and would ultimately only contribute to urban sprawl in the region and put pressure on existing services and amenities in the area.The garden city type of development dates back to the 19th century and I would highly recommend avoiding this option as it will contribute towards many of the problems suburban areas like Hart currently have.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"Option 1 is the nearest to what I think should happen. We must look to our town and village centres to focus this new development. This will allow the centres to thrive financially and socially with the added population within walking distance.By focusing this development in areas where infrastructure is located already, it reduces the need for as many cars and allows existing services such as libraries, community centres, GP's and cultural places to survive and thrive.Fleet town centre provides an excellent prospect for a denser and more sustainable housing opportunity; I have explored this option in further detail to understand how this could work in terms of numbers and social opportunities (please see document - Local Plan Response form - Housing Development Option 6 by Gareth Robert Price)","q5":"I have worked with the current London Housing Standards on various projects and I believe they could be improved. They do, however, serve as a base point for developers when considering sites and can stop low standards.I would advise and plead for Hart District Council to adopt and enforce these standards and in the future look to improve on them where possible.Strict environmental codes should be introduced with the aim to reduce carbon emissions in buildings. Passive housing should be an aim to look for in all housing in the next 10 years.Furthermore looking at higher density housing in the centre does not mean reducing dwelling sizes or avoiding good design. In fact many developments in countries such as Denmark and Netherlands, where avoiding urban sprawl is even more important, they have larger unit sizes and tend to be of higher quality than the traditionally poorly build houses in the UK.Using the exceptional talent we have in our own country, council architects in Winchester would allow for a real positive future for the borough, along with many other talented architects in the region to make positive contributions.Please find attached to this form a document explaining the ideas I am referring to - Local Plan Response form - Housing Development Option 6 by Gareth Robert PriceI look forward to seeing how this exciting opportunity develops and your decisions in the summer of 2015.","i":361},

Home owners in rural parts of Hart on the whole have chosen to live in a rural location. The council apparently wish to alleviate the impact of future development on current Hart residents. I would suggest that extra housing in and around the currently built up areas would have a lower level of negative impact on residents. whereas large development in rural areas would have a very negative impact on the currnt residents.Winchfield (an area mooted for a new town) offers within Hart a truly rural landscape for walkers, cyclists and residents who want to enjoy the countryside on their doorstep. Why is Hart Council even considering decimating this area.The draft strategy states that getting Option 4 up and running will take approx 10 years. Hart district needs to build an average of 250 houses per year. As a result, even if OPtion 4 were selected Options 1, 2, or 3 would also need to be selected and would require to provide 2,500 houses before Option 4 even starts. Once those 2,500 houses had been built it would no longer be necessary to carve up Hart countryside to provide 4,000 houses. Therefore it is not appropriate to even have Option 4.With regard to Option 2, I do believe each area within Hart should accept, and have a say in, a proportional amount of new build to their area. Say a 5% or 10% increase. Extra revenue would go to Hart Council as a result of Council Tax and builders levy to go towards improving the current infrastructure for the areaConsideration should be given to offering small peripheral developments suitable for local builders using local traders and craftsmen.

{"r":[3,1,2,4,5],"q1":"Option 2, the Dispersal Strategy is our preferred option, this will help to sustain most existing settlements and support existing services and facilities, and potentially bring about the provision of new services and facilities. This will also help to meet housing needs which arise locally at most settlements. We do however suggest that this option is amended slightly to take into account not only settlements in Hart's settlement hierarchy, but also settlements outside the District where these are on the border between Hart and other authority areas. A hybrid version of the dispersal option would consider development at settlements located on the border of the District, but which do not feature in the settlement hierarchy. For example, the site we have put forward in the SHLAA with this representation is on the edge of Riseley, a settlement in Wokingham, but the site is located within Hart District. There is no reason why development at such a location could not be included in a slightly amended version of the dispersal option. Option 2 would not necessarily need to be based on enabling growth in proportion to a settlement's size. This would be better based on what land was available at the various settlements, as it is highly unlikely that the land availability will match proportionate growth at each settlement. Without land being available it will be very difficult to deliver growth at the various settlements.It is not necessarily true that smaller developments can provide less in terms of infrastructure. It is often the case that large scale sites face higher delivery costs, and therefore can provide less in terms of infrastructure. This is reflected in the approach some Councils are taking to CIL, where major strategic allocations are rated £0 per square metre due to the high costs already associated with the delivery of these sites. The benefit of smaller sites is that they can often be delivered more quickly than larger sites and either provide infrastructure on the ground, or provide financial contributions towards infrastructure that is ultimately then delivered by the Council. It is unlikely that there will be sufficient opportunities to meet housing needs if the settlement focus option is pursued. The redevelopment of existing employment land within settlements is likely to prove problematic and will take time to deliver. It is unlikely that such sites would deliver in years 0-5 of the plan.Option 5 does not accord with the principles of the NPPF in particular the golden thread that runs through the document of the presumption in favour of sustainable development. Instead this focuses on a single issue and seeks to direct development to the least sustainable areas of the District. The focus is not even on one aspect of sustainability (environment), but on part of the environmental aspect of sustainability.

This includes the necessity to improve the associated infrastructure in multiple locations which is not deliverable and would not be cost effective.

{"r":[1,3,2,5,4],"q1":"Option 1 is an acknowledgement of one of the shortcomings of the SHLAA process, which is that sites within settlement boundaries are not being assessed until landowners inform the Planning Authority that they may be made available. Current planning policies support redevelopment and infill, so there is no real reason why landowners should disclose any potential development ideas ahead of time. These sites will only appear within the SHLAA if the Authority adopts a proactive approach and encourages all landowners and others to register plots with potential.The 850 dwellings figure represents a guess as to the number of 'windfall' sites which are likely to be granted permission during the Plan period without being specifically allocated. It represents an under-estimate of the possible provision, were the detailed work to be done to promote redevelopment and regeneration in areas in need of investment.The 'Further work' paragraph recognises that there is greater potential in both allocated and windfall sites within settlement boundaries which could be exploited through new policies supporting regeneration and re-use of existing sites. This might include policies to encourage 'living over the shop', which would bring into, or back into, residential use the spaces that are currently wasted in retail and employment buildings.Option 2 places a disproportionate emphasis on the growth of those settlements that are the least sustainable, without the volume of build that would secure the real infrastructure improvements that would be required to improve their sustainability. Allocations of, say, a 10% growth figure to smaller settlements over and above their natural growth/'windfall' development, when it is acknowledged (in the 'Constraints' section) that those sorts of percentages are not currently possible for some of the major settlements, places the growth burden on the wrong sites.The expectation that a high proportion of these sites would be identified by local communities, rather than being developer/landowner led proposals, introduces an additional delay to site allocation. Postponing site allocation may lead to challenges to the soundness of the Plan on the grounds that the figures given to individual communities could not, necessarily, be regarded as deliverable. An alternative method of boosting the housing contribution to be made by smaller settlements, on acceptable sites, would be by way of a full public review of the settlement boundaries. However, this would, again, introduce further delay when an early decision on the Plan is essential to protect open countryside from being lost to speculative applications on inappropriate sites.Option 3 refers to 'relevant infrastructure triggers' and recognises that there are step-changes in the provision of infrastructure required to accommodate growth, which would be ignored by simply fixing on a percentage growth rate for all communities. This option recognises that site allocations should take into account both the capacity of existing infrastructure to accommodate growth and the opportunities of new infrastructure provision to address existing shortfalls.A major advantage of focussing growth in strategic urban extensions is that it encourages development in the most sustainable locations and, by expanding the boundaries of existing urban areas, reduces to a minimum the impact of 'suburbanisation' of the surrounding open countryside. This would mean that the greatest possible proportion of the District was preserved from the harmful impacts of development, such as light pollution, loss of tranquillity, etc. The maintenance of the highest quality open countryside would be of great benefit to both urban and rural residents, as it is a resource which is important to the general public and prized by Hart District.Option 4 would be the most damaging and the most divisive option. Despite the diagrammatic representation of a 'Winchfield' location other 'new settlement' options have been canvassed in the past. Were HDC to select this option, it would open the door to proposals for sites from across the District. Each developer would identify a site to compete, in order that they are not shut out of the market. The recognised delay in the identification of the most suitable (or least-worst) site would, inevitably, lead to a delay in the Plan process, leaving the whole District open to speculative proposals in the interim. The major change in strategic planning from the South East Plan based housing figure to one derived from a Housing Market Needs Assessment has shifted the goalposts too far and too late for proper consideration of this option in Hart, at this stage.CPRE NEH cannot support the option of a new settlement, on principle. This form of development would alter not only the countryside on which it was built, but also a swathe of open countryside around it. Of all the options, the creation of an entirely new circle of urban hinterland would have the most damaging impact on the open countryside, which is so valuable to both CPRE and Hart District Council.Option 5 is not founded on valid planning criteria. The Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (TBH SPA) is a geo-ecological concept. Whilst it impacts on the ability of its surrounding zone of influence to accommodate housing development, it cannot be said to influence housing development decisions beyond that limit. Therefore, the designation of the TBH SPA cannot have made those parts of the District beyond its zone of influence more suitable for housing development than they were before.CPRE NEH believes that if there are houses that cannot be provided because of the adverse impact that they would have on the TBH SPA then these should be deleted from the District's target figure. This was accepted by the Minister, Brandon Lewis, when he spoke at a public meeting in Fleet, recently. It is precisely the sort of constraint that he referred to as being a legitimate reason for the District to have a planned growth rate that fell short of a statistically derived housing need figure.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"There should be policies that enable consideration of housing provision within villages and hamlets, especially if it is specifically sought by local residents. However, it is unlikely that the contributions to overall housing provision figures are likely to be high enough to make any significant alteration to the options for housing development.Even the level of new housing that might be envisaged for the redevelopment of the Bramshill House or Minley Manor estates, in the open countryside, are unlikely to influence the decision on the appropriate options. However, they (and any other similar proposals) will need to be borne in mind when considering infrastructure provision.There is a far greater potential to change the overall character of smaller villages and hamlets through inappropriate housing development. Therefore, measures to ensure that new developments respect the existing vernacular and are of a form and scale appropriate to their neighbours and location are even more important in smaller communities. CPRE NEH supports the use of Landscape Character Assessments by local communities in identifying the most appropriate solutions, as and when communities feel that there is a need to grow.","q3":"There are differing views on how large a new settlement would need to be to become truly sustainable. It has been suggested that settlements of anything less than 10,000 homes would be considered to be reliant on neighbours for services, employment, etc. There are no sites within Hart where a development of this size could remain as a separate town. A new settlement that coalesces with an existing settlement is little different to an urban extension.Therefore, within Hart, the only option would be a satellite settlement, reliant on another urban centre. This would require an easy access system between the satellite settlement and the urban centre of its host and sufficient capacity within the host centre to service the urban needs of the satellite.CPRE NEH has not carried out any of the work required to identify which, if any, sites in Hart District might accommodate a satellite settlement.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"The most urgent need in Hart District is for affordable housing, which none of the proposed options would see fully addressed for up to ten years. Might there be an opportunity for granting temporary change of use of land within or adjacent to existing settlements for the establishment of temporary low-cost homes? At various times of housing crisis, in the past, innovative ideas for pre-fabs, emergency housing, etc. have helped ease the situation. There are modern takes on pre-fabs, such as complete homes in a container, which can be installed in days. Finding a few temporary sites to take ten to twenty of those for, say, five years, when the 5-year land supply slips below the 105-120% level, would be far better than losing prime greenfield sites on appeal. By deleting the uplift in land values associated with a permanent change of use from, say, agricultural to residential, the properties would benefit from an automatic 30% discount in prices. The use of new technologies in the provision of temporary housing could see a further 30% cut in the design and build costs compared to permanent dwellings. There would also be substantial reductions in the running costs of such units, making them truly affordable. Apart from housing those in need of affordable homes, the twin objectives would be to relieve the immediate pressure to release green field sites indiscriminately and to secure sufficient lead time to develop proper planned solutions to meet current and future needs.CPRE NEH considers that the concentration on achieving housing targets, regardless, is not only leading to the wrong type of development in the wrong places but also to a failure to satisfy the identified needs that are the driving force behind the District Council's urgent 'need' to grant permissions.","q5":"CPRE NEH's response is made following consultation with local CPRE members. It does not preclude individual members from making their own responses to the consultation.By basing the illustrative distributions on the current SHLAA, the paper replicates a shortcoming of the SHLAA process. Sites that are suitable for housing, but have not been offered by landowners are not assessed. There ought to be a case for considering sites where the current lack of 'availability' might be the only or a major factor that is preventing their allocation.The status of the ‘Settlement Hierarchy for Hart District' is still that of a document adopted for the purposes of the review. There has been no public consultation on it or on where the divide should be between settlements that are sustainable and settlements that are not.At a national level, CPRE has carried out research which shows that SHMA predictions are based on aspirational demand rather than on identifiable and realistic need. So that, in economically buoyant areas, adopting SHMA predictions as targets is likely to lead to an oversupply of land allocated for housing. However, CPRE NEH recognises that HDC must, at this stage, work within the current framework, so accepts that it must use the OAHN figure. During each review of the Plan, any overestimate, assessed against the number of houses that have actually been built, will need to be corrected. Whilst the paper does mention the concept of a 'cap' on housing figures due to the TBH SPA, there is, as yet, no consultant's report on its possible impact. CPRE NEH considers that HDC is correct in assessing the optimal planning solution to allocating sites to meet its calculated housing market need, prior to assessing how consideration of the impact on the SPA might make some of that housing provision impossible. The total number of houses and the annual build rates remain dependent on the outcome of research into the impacts of the TBH SPA on the deliverability of housing within the zone of influence without adverse impacts on the SPA. Any shortfall that cannot be accommodated due to the SPA should be deleted from the total. Therefore, CPRE NEH's comments are made on the basis that the TBH SPA mitigation measures can be proven to be effective and scalable. If they are proven not to be effective or if variations in the level of SANG provision, financial contributions for site management and monitoring, etc. are required in order to make them effective, then that evidence or those changes may mean that these comments will have to be reconsidered. The housing delivered should, at least, meet the housing needs that have been identified and used to justify the housing figures within the Plan. The siting, size, tenure, etc. of the units delivered must match the recognised needs. If the requirement is for a high proportion of single person households, provision should not be skewed towards 3- to 5-bedroom houses. Similarly, where the requirement is for affordable housing, the delivery must be affordable. It would not help to make up any shortfall in affordable housing provision by increasing market housing provision. Given that the District is recognised as being a highly desirable place to live with a high cost of living and an over-dependence on private transport, the cost of any affordable housing provided must be sufficiently low, that those in need can afford to occupy and live in it.","i":482},

Nor would it provide the number of homes required within the envisaged timescale.Option 5 is a travesty of planning policies thanks to the inability of HDC and neighbouring LPAs to challenge the whole concept of the TBH SPA. The implication of this approach is that had the SPA extended to 90% of the District, development would be concentrated in the other 10%. Housing that would be scheduled within the SPA exclusion areas of the District should be deleted from the requirement for as long as the SPA policies stand.

In order to sustain the character of our villages and countryside, only sufficient housing should be allocated to smaller conurbations to accommodate the natural growth generated by those living in the locality. This implies infill within settlements rather than new estates on the fringe.","q3":"As per the answer to Q1: FORGET IT!","q4":"Yes","q4a":"The proper place for housing development is within an urban context if most of the rural character of the district is to be sustained. Within Hart, only Fleet and the North-east corner of the district (Yately and Hawley) have the potential to accommodate sufficient new housing at a reasonably high density, say up to 50 dph, to make a real dent in the current requirement without impinging on the character on most of the rural part of the district. Had the areas named above been part of the same LPA as Blackwater and Sandhurst, there is little doubt that it would have already been coalesced into a potentially appropriate development area.","q5":"This exercise has come about through the failure of the NPPF and the failure of the Coalition parties, as mirrored by Hart's District Councillors, to rebel against the travesty of good planning practice it represents, irrespective of well-meaning policies.This has swung the balance of interest against responsible national planning, such as to consider the role of cities and the protection of countryside beyond the Green Belt, while favouring the priorities of developers and their preference for greenfield sites. This is without delivering even the number of new homes envisaged in the previous South-east Plan. Only now is the government talking about brownfield sites and affordable housing, thanks to an imminent General Election, with little current encouragement for responsible planners in LPAs who have to operate under the NPPF straitjacket.It is, or should be, self-evident that well-designed urban development offers higher densities and the satisfactions of better transport connections, community support and infrastructure at less cost to national character than the sprawl implied by development of estates in villages. Inevitably, these change the character of their locality, while taking up more land with higher carbon intensity thanks to poorer access to public transport and more need for private cars.The recent winners of the Wolfson prize for Economics argue for housing to be concentrated in cities or garden suburbs, where urban development belongs. In Hart the only urban area is Fleet, with its excellent transport connections etc. on which the planners and developers minds should be concentrated.","i":483},

Most of the people using the medical services are of a mature age, and this category will be increased by new developments as they will be the only category, in the main, who will be able to afford the housing. Additionally, there isn't an adequate public transport systems in place now - how are people with no transport of their own going to get to schools, hospitals, doctors, dentists and shops? It will call for a massive increase in public transport, with the associated cost.

Maintaining this (i.e. limiting the amount of Greenfield land required and the effect on its character) must be a top priority when considering sites to be allocated for major new housing development.Option 1 'concentrating new housing development within existing boundaries' - should therefore be the first consideration. The relatively small number of new houses this would provide means this option must be joined with other(s).Hart is full when considering rail and road capacity, schools, doctors' practices etc. Whereever 4000 additional homes are built in the District, with the increase in population new infrastructure will be required. Consequently as a second priority new development should be sited where it will obtain maximum assistance in this regard.Whilst Option 4 might achieve this, because (a) it does not meet the first priority and (b) suffers from long lead-in times, it should be given least consideration. Of the remaining options listed, both Options 2 and 3 seem to meet priority 1 but 'Focused Growth' (option 3) must have the better chance of obtaining the highest level of funding. I suggest both would have similar levels of effect on the character of the District. With regard to Option 5 this seems vague and to have many uncertainties. It would not provide sufficient new development even in conjunction with Option 1. In any case it could be satisfied by Option 3. In my opinion therefore the least harmful to the District as a whole would be a combination of Options 1 and 3.Two general matters I would like to mention:1. You expect the adoption of a new Local Plan will take a further two years. Undoubtedly new planning applications will be received in the meantime. Can we be sure that, if accepted, these will be included as part of the 4000 new home required of us?2.

They have walked roughshod all over Hart District Councils planning committee to somehow manage to receive approval for a development which will do nothing to enhance the existing community and everything to ensure that Charles Church make as much profit as possible with the minimum of thought or effort going into the legacy that they will be leaving behind..At the end of the day the Council are elected by the members of the local community and their wages are paid for with the tax paid by those residents. Their priority should be to ensure that the people who live in what has been frequently voted as the 'best area of the country to live in' are listened to and that it is the will of the people that wins out and not that of the profit driven developers who will never have to live in the developments that they build.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"The inclusion of a very low level of new houses in these villages should not have any negative impact on the residents as long as the properties built are sympathetic to the existing dwellings and are in no way overly dominating, for example by all being built next to each other.

That is a full 18 years in which to deliver the number of homes that have been specified by the government. Why not take the approach to meet these targets over a slow and steady delivery programme rather than just focusing on what can possibly be delivered in the next 2 to 8 years.

{"r":[1,5,4,3,2],"q1":"Option 1SETTLEMENT FOCUS Growth takes place within the existing towns and villages.This is, effectively, the sort of development that will come forward, normally, on infill and redevelopment sites within existing settlements. If the sites can be identified at this stage, then their allocation will save green field sites from having to be identified. If they come forward without having been allocated, they will be classed as 'windfall' sites. These dwellings can be counted in housing provision calculations after their construction, but cannot count towards the 5 year land supply calculations ahead of construction. Each site that can be identified reduces the problem of finding greenfield sites. However, the total number of houses is unlikely to satisfy the whole of the 'housing need' so this option would need to be supplemented by at least one other option.The number of 'windfalls' is notoriously difficult to predict. However, Eversley's defined settlements do have areas of low density housing. Many of these have been put forward for redevelopment at higher densities in the past. Some have been granted during the plan period and others are still being discussed. Over the whole of the Plan period, there might be in the region of, say, 55 to 65 new dwellings on existing sites or on 'exception sites' for local affordable housing. This would equate to a 10% increase in housing numbers, which is more than 60% of the overall housing growth rate required across the whole District during the Plan period. (This would suggest that Eversley would only need to find another 35 to 45 sites to be carrying its full share of the District's burden.) It is unlikely that all individual housing sites within the settlement boundaries will be identified prior to adoption of the Plan, so these sites will not appear as allocations. However, Eversley will still be making a significant contribution to Hart's total housing need through 'windfall' development.Option 2DISPERSAL STRATEGY Spreads the growth around the edges of the main towns and villages.In 2006 HDC produced a draft Preferred Options document for its Core Strategy, which proposed a new 'settlement hierarchy' for the District, which included ‘Eversley Centre' and ‘Eversley Cross and Up Green' as smaller settlements and removed the settlement boundaries from ‘Eversley and Up Common' (sic) and ‘Lower Common' 'on the basis that, with limited or no services or public transport, they do not constitute sustainable locations for new housing.' EPC contested this designation and suggested that, as none of the various hamlets that constitute the village of Eversley was any more sustainable than any other, they should either all be included or all be excluded. Preparation of that Core Strategy stalled. In January 2010, Hart District Council recommended a new 'settlement hierarchy' as part of the preparation for a new Core Strategy. That designated ‘Eversley Centre' and ‘Eversley Cross and Up Green' as 'Main Villages' and ‘Eversley Street' and ‘Lower Common' as 'Smaller Villages'. EPC again disputed the designations and also requested that ‘Eversley Cross' and ‘Up Green' be recorded as separate hamlets, rather than as a single entity. EPC's and HDC' interpretations were due to be tested by the Inspector at the Examination in Public into the Core Strategy. Unfortunately, this was abandoned when the Inspector suggested that HDC should withdraw the Core Strategy. Therefore, the suggested 'settlement hierarchy' has yet to be tested. Despite the lack of agreement about the settlement hierarchy, HDC continues in the assumption that Eversley Centre and Eversley Cross and Up Green are sustainable locations for new housing. The Dispersal Strategy puts green fields around each as potential allocations. Yateley is regarded as a 'Primary Local Service Centre', so would be regarded as a main town. Any extension to the west of Yateley would have to be built on land in Eversley. Therefore, this option concentrates the planners' and developers' attention on very large swathes of the parish.Eversley cannot accept any new allocations of housing on these sites, whether as extensions of Eversley settlements or as an extension of Yateley. Please refer to the response to Q5, below, which concludes that 'Eversley finds itself, due to decisions made in Wokingham, in an 'all or nothing' situation. Infrastructure constraints preclude any level of planned growth below that which might be associated with a new settlement. It would not appear to be possible, logistically, to develop new towns at Arborfield and Eversley concurrently, so that, effectively, rules out the possibility of any growth in Eversley beyond that that will be achieved through infill, redevelopment and the identification of any further exception policy sites.' Option 3FOCUSED GROWTH (Strategic Urban Extensions) Focuses growth on the edge of one or two of the existing towns.Although the illustration in the consultation implies that the 'one or two' towns are limited to Hook and Fleet, the draft 'settlement hierarchy' includes ‘Yateley' and ‘Blackwater' in the same category as Hook, therefore these would equally be considered as main towns. Since any expansion of Yateley and Blackwater is limited to the north and east by the floodplain and to the south by the TBH SPA the only realistic opportunity for major growth would be to the west of Yateley, which would be on land in Eversley. Therefore, this option might target fields in Eversley on the Yateley boundary. Any housing development on these sites would reduce the open gap between Eversley and Yateley, making the retention of existing open fields on the east of Eversley Cross more important than ever.Eversley cannot accept any new allocation of housing as an extension of Yateley. Please refer to the response to Q5, below, which concludes that 'Eversley finds itself, due to decisions made in Wokingham, in an 'all or nothing' situation. Infrastructure constraints preclude any level of planned growth below that which might be associated with a new settlement. It would not appear to be possible, logistically, to develop new towns at Arborfield and Eversley concurrently, so that, effectively, rules out the possibility of any growth in Eversley beyond that that will be achieved through infill, redevelopment and the identification of any further exception policy sites.' Option 4FOCUSED GROWTH (New Settlement) Identifies a new town, which would be capable of growing to a minimum of 4,000, although only 2,000 dwellings may be deliverable by 2032.The illustration in the consultation implies that the new settlement would be centred on Winchfield. This is the site that has been advanced most recently, but is not the only possible one. Hook, Bramshill and Eversley have all been proposed for new settlements in the past. Two of which went to appeal and were turned down. The site in Bramshill is now protected as part of the TBH SPA. If HDC was to select a Focused Growth option, every rural parish would be targeted, particularly by developers who are not already part of any Winchfield proposal. This option would commit Hart to high housing growth rates during and beyond the plan period and one or more existing communities to complete change.Option 5SPA AVOIDANCE STRATEGY Targets those areas beyond the 5 km Zone of influence of the TBH SPA.This option would, obviously, help to minimise the housing pressures on Eversley, so is, naturally, the first place that EPC would look for new growth to be allocated, beyond that that will be achieved within existing settlements. It is assumed that each of the settlements beyond the influence of the SPA, ‘North Warnborough', ‘Odiham', ‘RAF Odiham', ‘South Warnborough' and ‘Long Sutton' will be taking a completely different view.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"None of the options bar housing in Hart's smallest villages and hamlets, they simply don't propose to allocate sites for housing development within or adjacent to them. The only reason for considering such allocations within the overall strategy would be if the new housing proposals for the smallest villages and hamlets were to make a substantial contribution to the overall figure of more than 4,000 homes.Whilst the settlement hierarchy has yet to be established, Eversley Parish could contain a number of Hart's 'smallest villages and hamlets', namely New Mill Road, Lower Common, Warbrook Lane, Eversley Street, and Up Green, if not Eversley Centre and Eversley Cross as well. There may be some opportunities for them to accept modest growth, but if '… they do not constitute sustainable locations for new housing …' any contribution that they can make to overall housing numbers will not be significant.The 'exception policy' for local affordable housing is seen to have worked well and provided much needed local housing when and where the local community felt it was necessary. There are other reasons why smaller communities may wish to welcome housing growth and it would be sensible not to make planning policies so restrictive as to rule out the possibility entirely. However, such growth should be community not developer led and, again, will not make a significant contribution to overall housing numbers.","q3":"The natural answer from any local community's point of view would be 'As far away as possible and as large as possible', as this would guarantee least impact for itself.However, in Eversley's case, where there are extreme restrictions on the community's ability to accommodate any growth beyond its Option 1 level, the only scale of designated growth that could possibly deliver the new infrastructure package required would be at the 'new settlement' level. Eversley appears to be in an 'All or nothing' position. An enormous amount of detailed work would be required to assess the viability of such an option, wherever it was in Hart, against the known constraints. It is not considered possible, at this late stage, to incorporate a 'new settlement' in this Local Plan. However, it is equally important to ensure that ad hoc decisions at this stage do not prevent proper consideration of this type of development option for the District at the first review of the Local Plan.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"A very large proportion of the recognised housing need, especially the part that is unfulfilled 'need' carried over from the previous Plan period, appears to be classed as 'affordable', whereas the provision does not appear to meet that need fully for ten years.Local knowledge suggests that there are an increasing number of properties where current economics make it sensible to co-occupy properties. This is achieved by anything from renting out a room to, effectively, creating a separate dwelling by sub-division to accommodate a family member or friend. Much of this is done informally. However, the records will show that these 'concealed households' are in housing need, when they are not actually competing in the housing market. A statistical exercise that does not recognise this reality is likely to overestimate housing demand/need. This is not to deny the existence of real cases of hardship where additional housing units are required. If the planning regulations were not quite so rigid, the existence of these sub-units of accommodation could be recognised without the presumption that they could be sold off as separate dwellings. Such sub-division of existing dwellings would increase the supply of housing without the need for new build, so has the capacity to satisfy demand in the affordable sector far more quickly. Full recognition of the existing hidden dwellings and enabling policies to promote such provision would target the affordable housing need swiftly and help to minimise the pressure, attributable to the NPPF, to release inappropriate greenfield sites for development. This option might be referred to as 'making best use of existing built development', so it is encompassed within Option 1, but could make a very significant contribution to increasing the number of homes available under that option.","q5":"The Paper fails to address the carrying capacity of the environment or infrastructure, so that consideration of the options is being carried out as an academic rather than realistic process.At Option 3, under 'Potential scale of housing delivery', the paper notes '… Hampshire County Council uses guidelines when assessing the need for new primary school places that would equate to one form of entry required for every 700 new homes.' Eversley and Bramshill are reliant on Charles Kingsley's Primary School, which has a one-form entry policy. The current level of housing in Eversley and Bramshill is approaching 700 and will exceed that through natural growth/infill within a few years. Therefore, Eversley is in a position where any level of allocated new growth will mean the retraction of the CKS catchment area and village children having to leave the village for primary education, thus fragmenting the community. The next step-change would be the provision of another Primary School, which might only be possible or financed through the doubling of the size of the village.There are other elements of infrastructure provision that, also, are not linear. That is to say they cannot be increased in line with any chosen level of growth. For Eversley, a particular issue is the capacity of the A327 and its junctions, as this is the main north-south link with Berkshire and beyond. Wokingham Borough Council is about to consider two planning applications for a total of approximately 3,500 houses at, and south of, Arborfield Garrison, within a mile of Eversley. These are over and above approximately 2,000 new dwellings being built at Shinfield on the A327. The Transport Assessments show that these developments will use the entire spare capacity of the A327 in Eversley. EPC believes that they have underestimated the additional traffic burden on the A327 to the south of the sites. In this case, the step-change would involve the construction of another crossing of the River Blackwater. Whilst a number of options have been looked at there is no doubt that this could not be achieved for less than, say, £9,000,000. Therefore, unless such funding can be sourced elsewhere, Eversley is not in a position to accept any planned development that could not generate this level of investment in essential infrastructure.Eversley finds itself, due to decisions made in Wokingham, in an 'all or nothing' situation. Infrastructure constraints preclude any level of planned growth below that which might be associated with a new settlement. It would not appear to be possible, logistically, to develop new towns at Arborfield and Eversley concurrently, so that, effectively, rules out the possibility of any growth in Eversley beyond that that will be achieved through infill, redevelopment and the identification of any further exception policy sites.","i":544},
{"r":[2,1,3,5,4],"q1":"As set out in paragraph 2.1 of the Housing Development Options Consultation Paper (HDOCP), Hart is a predominately rural district. It is therefore important that the Council's housing strategy supports the vitality and viability of the rural communities. The Taylor Report (2008) recognises that new housing development in rural areas has an important role to play in this regard and states: 'A mix of housing and employment opportunities is essential for the sustainability of rural communities'.The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) also states at paragraph 55: 'To promote sustainable development in rural areas, housing should be located where it will enhance or maintain the vitality of rural communities'. The National Planning Policy Guidance provides further guidance stating: 'It is important to recognise the particular issues facing rural areas in terms of housing supply and affordability, and the role of housing in supporting the broader sustainability of villages and smaller settlements... ...A thriving rural community in a living, working countryside depends, in part, on retaining local services and community facilities such as schools, local shops, cultural venues, public houses and places of worship. Rural housing is essential to ensure viable use of these local facilities. Assessing housing need and allocating sites should be considered at a strategic level and through the Local Plan and/or neighbourhood plan process'.The general approach of dispersing new housing through the District adjacent to both the main settlements and larger villages (Option 2) is therefore supported in principle as it is the only option which will help to sustain the rural communities. This is recognised on page 44 of the HDOCP which states that Option 2 presents the opportunity of 'All town, village and local service centres across Hart benefit from additional housing to support employment, retail and other services and to allow for local economic growth'.However, a more sophisticated approach as to how the housing requirement is most appropriately distributed amongst these settlements is needed. It is acknowledged that the HDOCP is an early stage consultation document, and the 10% of existing housing stock growth amount for each settlement suggested under Option 2 is a 'starting point' and may not necessarily be appropriate or possible in every settlement.However, importantly, this option fails to provide any link between the levels of growth proposed and the level of services and facilities at the settlements. Clearly, the main urban settlements of Fleet/Church Crookham and Yateley/Blackwater benefit from the greatest level of services and facilities. However, the HDOCP states that these settlements 'have insufficient identified adjacent sites to allow for a 10% increase although a 5% increase could be achieved if all identified sites proved to be developable and where taken forward' (WYG emphasis) and 'as such the rural parts of the District may need to accept more than their proportionate share in order to meet overall housing requirements'. The Settlement Hierarchy Paper identifies 10 'main villages' in these rural parts of the District and these have been included in Option 2 of the HDOCP as suitable locations for growth. However, the Settlement Hierarchy Paper fails to recognise that Eversley is effectively made up of Eversley Cross, Eversley Centre/Up Green and arguably Eversley Street/Lower Common which are all located within a small geographical area within which services and facilities are shared or that 'where there are groups of smaller settlements, development in one village may support services in a village nearby' (NPPF, paragraph 55). Certainly, Eversley Centre and Eversley Cross/Up Green are located very close together (note the Option 2 map on page 45 of the HDOCP simply refers to 'Eversley') and combined provide services and facilities falling within 8 out of the 12 services/facilities categories listed including a convenience store, 3 comparison stores, 3 public houses, a post office, a primary school and a children's play area/playing field. This is in addition to a daily bus service and 8,000sqm of employment floorspace - the only village listed as offering any employment floorspace other than Crondell. It should also be noted that the village benefits from significant recreation facilities at Eversley Quarry including a nature reserve, nine hole golf course, numerous playing fields, water sports facilities and an indoor cricket centre (in addition to the cricket pitch off Reading Road). Further sizeable areas of recreational facilities are planned as part of the ongoing restoration of the quarry. These extensive top class facilities are arguably the largest in the District vastly exceeding that provided at many of the other higher order settlements.Eversley (ie. Eversley Centre, Eversley Cross/Up Green) also benefits from its proximity to Yateley and the many services and facilities that this settlement has to offer as the second largest urban area in the District. In particular, the western part of Yateley, closest to Eversley Cross, supports a Waitrose supermarket, secondary school, junior and infant schools and doctor's surgery amongst other facilities, all within approximately 2kms walking distance of Eversley. See attached Sustainability Plan which illustrates the level of facilities available in Eversley and the western side of Yateley.Eversley therefore ranks as the main village with the largest amount of services and facilities within the Council's Settlement Hierarchy Paper and therefore the most sustainable. As such, it is entirely appropriate that Eversley should take an increased proportion of housing compared to the other main villages which are less sustainable locations for new development.Our client has submitted land at Eversley as part of the call for sites process and also held a public exhibition in January this year setting out options for how this land could be developed for residential use. This land is suitable, available and achievable. Development of this land would help to sustain the vitality and viability of the rural community at Eversley as well as helping to address the significant need for market and affordable housing in the District.It should be noted that our client also owns land elsewhere in Eversley which could be brought forward to deliver environmental and highways benefits.The catchment areas of existing SANGS do not cover this part of the District. Our client is willing to bring forward a significant area of SANGS which will not only cater for any residential development on his other land ownership, but will provide additional capacity to allow for other smaller scale sites to come forward in this part of the District. Natural England have already visited the land and confirmed that it would make an excellent SANGS. As such, the release of land at Eversley would bring forward a significant new area of publically accessible natural green space helping to reduce visitor pressures at the Thames Basin Heaths SPA. This is a significant benefit which is unlikely to be capable of being delivered at many of the other main villages.Land could also be made available at the Marsh Lane / Reading Road junction to improve the current staggered junction arrangement which is an acknowledged problem locally.To conclude, Options 3, 4 and 5 which focus growth either in a single new settlement, a small number of urban extensions or in a relatively small portion of the District away from the SPA fail to provide development in the rural settlements across much of the District which are both capable of accommodating, and would benefit from, new development. Options 3 and 4 (Strategic Urban Extensions and New Settlement) will also take a considerable time to start delivering new housing and will not therefore address the short term pressing need for additional housing.Option 1 (Settlement Focus) relies mainly on brownfield sites within the settlements being released for residential development. It is unlikely that all of the sites that the Council's initial review has identified will come forward particularly as many are in existing employment use. Even if all the sites did come forward they would fall well short of delivering the District's housing requirement.Option 2 (Dispersal Strategy on sites adjacent to the main settlements and larger villages) must therefore present the most realistic and sustainable option for delivering the scale of housing needed, particularly in the shorter term. The main urban settlements have insufficient sites on land adjacent to the existing settlement boundaries and therefore the amount of housing directed to the main villages must be increased. Eversley is a sustainable location for residential development, ranking as the most sustainable main village in the Council's Settlement Hierarchy Paper. The proportion of growth identified for Eversley should therefore be increased significantly in line with the presumption in favour of sustainable development set out in the NPPF.","q2":"No","q2a":"These settlements do not have the level of services and facilities needed to support any significant scale of development. It is anticipated that the new Local Plan will include an exception policy which will allow for small scale affordable housing schemes to be brought forward where there is an identified need.","q3":"This is option is not supported as it will not meet the identified need for housing in the short and medium term. It also fails to deliver much needed new housing in the rural settlements.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"As set out above, the principle of dispersing housing through the District set out in Option 2 is supported but with increased housing provision identified for the main villages recognising the lack of identified sites in the main urban settlements and the need to help sustain these villages. The amount of development at Eversley should also be increased in recognition of its status as the most sustainable of the 10 main villages and the environmental and highway benefits that can be delivered in parallel to housing development.","q5":"We do not believe the Council have adequately demonstrated that they have satisfied the Duty to Cooperate particularly with regard to meeting neighbouring authorities' unmet housing need. The annual requirement for the HMA is 238 dwellings per annum less than the identified objectively assessed housing need for the area. This significant shortfall should be addressed now rather than hoping that it can be made up in the later years of the plan period. There also appears to be no consideration as to shortfalls against housing requirements in other neighbouring authorities outside of the HMA. For example East Hampshire's latest Housing Land Supply Position Statement sets out a shortfall (although WYG consider the shortfall is underestimated) but there is no consideration as to how HDC could help to take on this unmet need.The HDOCP sets out that the Council would need to deliver at least 650 dwellings per annum in order to meet the affordable housing need identified in the SHMA in the first five years of the plan period (assuming 40% of new homes are delivered as affordable). However, the Council argue that there is no justification for uplifting the housing requirement in order to meet the need for affordable housing. This is contrary to Paragraph 47 of the NPPF which requires Local Planning Authorities (LPA's) to meet their affordable and market housing needs in full and the NPPG which states that 'LPAs should aim to deal with any undersupply within the first 5 years of the plan period where possible'. Just because a target is challenging is not adequate justification for failing to make provision for adequate homes over the plan period. The housing requirement should therefore be increased significantly to meet open market and affordable housing needs and to help address any identified shortfalls in neighbouring authorities.","i":545},
{"r":[1,2,3,4,5],"q1":"See response to Q5","q2":"Yes","q2a":"For the reasons given in response to Q5 ,we consider that the best use of sites in existing settlements should be a priority before allocating land outside settlements.","q3":"Do not know","q4":"Don't know","q4a":"-","q5":"The Consultation Paper sets out in Section 3 the housing requirements that will be needed by 2032 and the difficulties in meeting those housing targets.Paragraph 3.35 and Table 3.3 provide an overview of the current housing supply situation across the HMA (Hart, Surrey Heath and Rushmoor). Table 3.3 clearly demonstrates the annual average completions (2011-2014) fall significantly short of the objectively assessed housing needs annual requirement (2011-2032). In the whole area the annual shortfall is 511 units against a housing need of 1,163. Thus the HMA area is currently only providing 55% of the assessed annual housing needs requirement for 2011-2032.The situation is summed up in paragraph 3.36 which states:-'In the light of the levels of housing supply currently being achieved and anticipated for the near future, it is clear that considerable work needs to be done by all three authorities in order to meet the objectively assessed housing need of the HMA as a whole….'And in paragraph 3.37:-'Given the nature of environmental constraints and the stretched capacity of infrastructure, it is certain that meeting the full housing requirement will be a genuine challenge and will require some difficult and potentially unpalatable decisions….'In order to address this serious shortfall, the Consultation Paper puts forward five options for future housing development strategy. The way that the options are presented in the Consultation make them appear as discrete choices although there is reference to the fact that more than one option could be applied.We consider that Option 1 ‘Settlement Focus' should not be put forward as an ‘option' of equal weight with the other options , but as a priority where the search for sites within settlement boundaries should be undertaken before the other options are considered . Given the environmental constraints of the District and the need to make best use of existing infrastructure it is inconceivable that the Local Authority would not want to make the best use of existing brown field land within existing settlement boundaries before considering other options that are going to have a greater environmental impact. It is National Policy that the best use should be made of brown field sites before taking greenfield land. One of the ‘Core planning principles' set out in paragraph 17 of the NPPF states that : 'encourage the effective use of land by reusing land that has been previously developed (brownfield land) ,provided that it is not of high environmental value.' Thus any option that did not require that all sites within settlements should be first considered before taking more sensitive rural land would be contrary to National Policy Guideance.Thus the Consultation Paper should state that the initial approach will always be to exhaust housing opportunities within existing settlements and if this leaves a shortfall, which inevitably it will, then to consider the other options that have been put forward in the Consultation Paper.This approach would be in line with the approach followed by other local authorities. In ‘Option 1' it states with regard to this point:-'Most Adopted Core Strategies (or Local Plans) have included this approach as part of their overall development strategy, though none (outside of major urban areas) have been able to rely on it entirely.SA comments:We fully understand the requirement for the Sustainability Appraisal Report but we consider that the way it has assessed the 5 Housing Development Options is flawed for the following reasons:-1. The report does not consider the effects of combining Options and the resulting impact on their ‘scores'. For example with regard to SA Objective 1, if Option 1 and 4 was combined then Option 1 would get a preference of 1 with Option 4, At the same time it would reduce the size of the New Settlement that is needed and thereby reduce its environmental impact. Because the option that uses Brownfield land can only provide part of the solution does not mean it should be penalised for that reason particularly when it meets one of the Core planning principles in theNPPF.2. With regard to Objective SA Objective 2 it is unsupportable to say Option 1 would have a ‘significant negative effect' because it could not provide new outdoor space and community facilities. The Report elsewhere states that the Health and Well Being in Hart is above the national average and that it is very well provided with open space provision. Under Option 1 new residents would have all the benefits of established facilities that may well benefit from new members and be integrated into established settled communities. There is no proper assessment of thewell documented social and health problems associated with moving large numbers of people into large new settlements.3. The same issues relate to SA Objective 3. For example cultural activities will be far better established in existing communities.4. With regard to SA Objective 5 Option 1 should score much higher than Option 4. New Settlements often have increased crime levels because of the social problems of settling large numbers of people in a new communities.5. With regard to SA Objective 6 the distinctiveness of existing communities is going to be best served by putting further housing in those communities as it will add new blood to them and keep them vibrant and at the same time reduce the need to expand existing or create new settlements.6. SA objectives 10,11,12,13 and 14 are all based on very subjective or little information and therefore the scores cannot be relied upon. SA objectives 17 to 20 are primarily scored on the basis that the more houses the higher the score which is not an in depth analysis. For example on Transport and Accessability this could be better by adding to existing settlements.We therefore consider that the Sustainability Appraisal scoring of the Options cannot be relied upon and clearly Option 1 has been under scored and should be higher ranked.","i":546},

{"r":[2,1,3,5,4],"q1":"Given the significant environmental constraints affecting much of Hart District, we consider that focusing development in and around existing main settlements and larger villages is the most suitable means of delivering the majority of new housing in the District. This approach is endorsed by Para 52 of the NPPF, which states that 'the supply of new homes can sometimes be best achieved through planning for larger scale development, such as new settlements or extensions to villages and towns that follow the principles of Garden Cities' [emphasis added].It enables housing to be provided more quickly in line with the requirements of the NPPF that housing sites should be ‘deliverable' (Footnote 11) and ‘developable' (Footnote 12).In our view, seeking to deliver a sizeable new settlement in such a constrained district (Option 4) would raise a range of complex, potentially insurmountable issues and could prove inimical to the need to 'boost significantly' the supply of housing in the district (NPPF para 47).By contrast, Option 2 would ensure a more even-handed approach, subject to site availability, and would ensure that no settlement experiences a disproportionate level of housing growth.Our client, CEMEX UK Properties, owns 48 Ha of agricultural and woodland at Eversley, and two plots (totalling just over 6 Ha) are suitable for residential development within the context of Option 2.We attach an associated ‘Design Concept' brochure, produced by master planners Terence O'Rourke, which shows how development could be brought forward in these two cases, and would in our view follow the principles endorsed by the NPPF.CEMEX is committed to working closely with the Parish Council and other key stakeholders, as well as Hart Council, to progress these conceptual ideas.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"Delivering housing through a larger number of generally small developments ensures that new housingareas can relate well to the existing built form of settlements.

Oddly when a plan was submitted for conversion of office blocks to accommodation for the elderly [which would have freed up regular homes suitable for families] permission was refused, and those office blocks have stood empty and gradually vandalised for well over seven years.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"Option 1 should focus on expanding the housing stock in the smaller rural villages to help support existing local services, shops and light industry. Whilst the modern trend is for 'shopping on line', physically going to the shops or popping out for odds and ends is an important element of social wellbeing enjoyed by people of all ages, especially for those living in singular of limited social groupings. Towns such as Fleet have a flourishing 'High Street' which I am sure contributes greatly to the 'best place to live' league table - often referred to in the media.

'It could be several years before homes are built' seems a ludicrous consideration to set before the local electorate. There has been construction of so many smallish local areas of both open space and redevelopment in Hart over the past few years, that there is little excuse for the whole process of producing a New Settlement becoming bogged down - it is merely a case of scaling up the will to succeed to and achieve.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"Option 5 if ever there was a prize for spot the obvious mistake, perhaps Hart District Council's interruption of the Thames Basin Heaths SPA would be a winner.

The Local Authority covering Bracknell Forest; which many Hart residents would most probably know, have, whilst working closely with a Housing Association, been able to erect 5,900 rented and 1100 leasehold properties. Whilst it is not suggested that we replicate another Reading, but the shattering of a few sacred green dreams and wishes conjured up in the cloated atmosphere of EU committee rooms, would not go amiss if we are to house and sustain our unstoppable population growth.","q5":"Option 2 Fringe development will only add to the principle problems of the existing poor highway infrastructure, increase the need for family owned transport to accommodate the mobility and needs of younger people. More buses for the elderly, school transport for the young and encourage larger shops which could ultimately destroy the existing well balanced village feel of our towns, by the creation of 'Out of town' supermarkets and multiple outlet traders. Option 3 Strategic Urban Extensions [SUE] - appear to have lost much UK support since 2004, it was the language of politicians and planners in places such as Cairo and Beijing. Sprawling 'add-ons' and the problems they create in areas such as education beyond Year 7, medical support, hospital facilities, infrastructure such as land drainage, sewerage, increased road usage and expansion in previously low volume vehicular areas, has made SUE's about as popular as an outbreak of Dengue Fever.","i":574},

{"r":["","","","",""],"q1":"There is insufficient information available at this stage in terms of the potential effect on the historic environment of any of these five options, as recognised in the Sustainability Appraisal, for English Heritage to express preferences between all the options. We welcome the recognition of the historic environment of Hart as a potential influence on the level and nature of housing development in some areas in paragraph 3.47, although we would prefer the paragraph to highlight the positive influence of a rich historic environment in terms of attractiveness to visitors and businesses and contribution to the quality of life for existing and future residents of the district, rather than simply casting the historic environment as a negative 'constraint' (e.g. 'constrained with' in the third sentence could be 'rich in' and 'affected by' in the last sentence could be 'benefitting from' or simply 'with'). Otherwise we agree with the general thrust of this paragraph.In Option 1, Conservation Area designations are recognition of the special architectural or historic interest of such areas. It is the potential effect on this special interest, informed by a Character Appraisal identifying the contribution of open spaces to that special interest, that should determine whether development on such open spaces is appropriate, rather than the designation itself. Paragraph 137 of the National Planning Policy Framework recognises that development within Conservation Areas would be appropriate if it enhanced or better revealed their significance. Clearly, however, if an open space makes a significant contribution to the special interest of a Conservation Area, its development would not enhance or better reveal the significance of the Area and would be inappropriate.In determining eventual locations to be allocated for new housing (and other development), English Heritage will look for a robust evidence base underpinning the selection in which the historic environment is given proper weight in accordance with statutory provisions and the National Planning Policy Framework. The effect on the significance of heritage assets, both designated and non-designated assets (information on which can be obtained from your Conservation Officer or the Historic Environment Record) and historic landscapes such as the Forest of Eversley (and with reference to the Hampshire Integrated Landscape Character Assessment), should be a consideration in the specific location and nature of proposed housing (or other) development. We would draw your attention particularly to paragraphs 169 and 170 of the Framework in respect of the historic environment evidence base and would comment that Appendix A contains no specific reference to any specific historic environment evidence for the district (except perhaps the Urban Characterisation and Density Study).In this respect we note that many of the settlements in the district contain or are in close proximity to designated heritage assets, including listed buildings and registered historic parks and gardens. As noted in paragraph 3.47, Hartley Wintney, Odiham and North Wanborough are particularly rich in designated assets, as are Rotherwick, Dogmersfield, South Wanborough and Crondall. Option 5, with its proposed concentration of new development in the south-west of the district, around Odiham, North Wanborough and South Wanborough, is therefore to be likely to have the greatest potential impact on designated heritage assets.We would also comment that paragraph 157 of the Framework requires local plans to identify land where development would be inappropriate perhaps because of its historic significance as well as because of its biodiversity interest.Further advice on local plans and the historic environment can be found in English Heritage's Historic Environment Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 1: 'The Historic Environment in Local Plans'. This is currently in a draft revised form, with the final version expected early in 2015. English Heritage is also intending to publish specific advice on site allocations and the historic environment in due course as a supplement to Note 1, but this is still at an early stage.

It supports the vitality and viability of centres and enables new houses to be integrated in to the community. The constraints listed in relation to this option are noted but it is considered that the local planning authority needs to be open to ideas to overcome some of the identified constraints. It should be acknowledged that on some sites the balance between the protection of certain assets and the delivery of housing may change either through the ‘need' for housing and need to grow the resident population to support the community facilities but also potentially through innovative design or other solutions which may tip the balance in favour of allowing development on sites that were previously considered ‘constrained' and excluded from housing supply figures.It is considered that option 2, Dispersal Strategy goes hand in hand with option 1 as there are sites within/adjacent to settlements in tiers 1-4 which offer natural extensions to existing settlements with many of the benefits of the settlement focus approach. As with the above comments, flexibility and balance needs to be applied to potential constraints and compromises made. It may be found that the balance may tip in favour of development with further consideration to design or meeting local needs. Option 5 is very interesting and possibly should be given great importance when considering sites under options 1 and 2 be a material consideration favouring development of housing sites outside the SPA 5km zone of influence. It is only this option that allows the protection of the SPA and the higher the number of houses delivered outside the SPA 5km zone of influence the less overall impact upon it. Priority should be given to option 1 and 2 sites outside of the SPA 5km zone perhaps in a type of sequential approach to development.It is not consider that options 3 or 4 really have the potential to deliver housing in the required time period with potentially further delays arising due to the reliance on a small number of large sites. It is appreciated that option 3 cannot deliver all the housing required, and it is therefore considered that option 1 and 2 should be reviewed in light of the SPA 5km zone of influence with priority given to the development outside of this zone. This will require some compromises to be made but it is important to look at the wider picture and remember the delivery of small sites can make a valuable contribution to overall housing numbers.","q2":"No","q2a":"-","q3":"N/A","q4":"No","q4a":"N/A","q5":"-","i":595},
{"r":["","","","",5],"q1":"These Representations do not seek to indicate a preference or comment specifically on each of the options for future housing delivery as outlined in the housing development options paper.However, JLL would comment that Option 5 (Focussing development away from the Thames Basin Heaths SPA Zone of Influence) appears to be a very high risk approach for the following reasons:1. Risks surrounding the deliverability of large-scale housing within a small part of the District. Such risks may include, but are not limited to:a. The delivery of the Council's housing strategy being dependent on a few sites that may be controlled by a select number of developers.b. The potential for ‘land banking' to further constrain housing supply over the short / medium term.c. The evident inability of the Council to demonstrate a 5 year supply of deliverable housing land when assessing only a small proportion of the District that is outwith of the SPA 5km buffer.d. Significant pressure being placed on the infrastructure of the small proportion of the District that would be subject to relatively intense form of development.e. Artificially constraining the supply of housing which would manipulate the supply and demand economics of the housing market, potentially resulting in fluctuations in the affordability of housing in different communities.2. The approach would result in a failure of the Council to provide a suitable mix and type of housing (and related infrastructure) across a large proportion of the District which could result in adverse implications for the social, environmental and economic facets of sustainability, contrary to guidance in the NPPF.3. The approach would result in all future housing being delivered to the south of the District which is relatively remote from the main centres of population and employment - resulting in an unsustainable approach to strategic housing delivery.4. The implications for areas of high landscape quality in the south west of Hart have not been fully assessed and as such there is no guarantee that Option 5 would be able to deliver the objectively assessed housing needs of the District.5. The suggestion that development within the 5km buffer of the SPA is incapable of mitigation appears to be unfounded. It is now a well-accepted principle that development within the 5km buffer is acceptable subject to mitigation using SANGs and SAMM. This principle is confirmed by previous development within the 5km buffer in Hart District and within numerous other local planning authority areas.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"It is considered that the Housing Development Options paper should not explicitly exclude the Tier 5 villages or major existing developed sites in the open countryside as potentially being able to accommodate growth.The withdrawn Core Strategy clearly recognises through Policy CS10 that there are a series of Major Facilities in the Countryside that, when they become redundant, would be available for redevelopment. Indeed, the draft document specifically recognises that Bramshill will become surplus to requirements. The fact that the Core Strategy has been withdrawn does not negate the fact that such major sites exist and their future active re-use must therefore be planned for. It is further noted that a number of Local Planning Authorities have ‘sound' policies that advocate the continued use / redevelopment of major sites in the Countryside.In the case of Bramshill (Police Training Centre due to vacate in March 2015) the Council have agreed a Development Brief (on the basis of the draft CS10 policy) that recognises that the existing buildings and land could provide a range of new uses, including housing, to both meet existing needs and ensure the long term protection and enhancement of the heritage and landscape assets.The Bramshill site is in the process of being acquired by City & Country, a leading specialist in the development of historic buildings. Bramshill has been included in the Call for Sites and although City & Country are looking at a number of possible uses, one of those uses could be the delivery of up to 250 residential units. To omit Bramshill (and other similar sites) from an assessment of the housing options for the District would appear to be a flaw in the plan making process.It is therefore considered that the housing options paper should logically recognise the delivery of major sites in the countryside in terms of their future contribution to housing delivery.","q3":"N/A","q4":"-","q4a":"N/A","q5":"Paragraph 1.2 of the Housing Options Paper advises that: 'at the heart of the new plan will be a strategy for dealing with new housing growth'.

Such a policy is required both in terms of major sites' potential to contribute to the delivery of housing and in terms of their ability to ensure an optimum viable use, as well as preserving and enhancing heritage and landscape assets - as is the case with Bramshill.This approach would be consistent with the position that was taken in the, now withdrawn, draft Core Strategy.City & County / JLL would be delighted to discuss these Representations, and the future active use of Bramshill, with Hart District Council Officers.","i":596},

{"r":[1,1,3,4,5],"q1":"We do not feel that we can rank a single option within the housing options paper in isolation as a preferred option. This is for a number of reasons, as outlined below. However, to assist we would prescribe the above ranking subject to the points made below.Firstly, with regards to our professional involvement within the Planning industry, we consider that it would be unconducive for the Council to select a very specific growth strategy, which only provides support for one form of growth. This is on the basis that we do not feel that a ‘one size, fits all approach' can be effectively applied as a means of delivering growth for a wide area across a long plan period and elements of the Housing Development Options Consultation paper and baseline evidence confirm this.In particular, we consider that the varying economic, social and environmental issues / conditions across the District will give rise to a range of developmental needs in different locations throughout the plan period. The specific nature of these needs / constraints within the District must be fully explored and understood when determining the growth strategy. Whilst we consider the current step to be useful in establishing local views on directions for growth, it is nevertheless clear that the plan must also provide a growth strategy which responds to the characteristics of the District outlined by its evidence base. This is confirmed by the high-level Sustainability Appraisal findings, which demonstrates that four of the options (Options 1-4), all to a degree demonstrate some likely positive effects. This suggests the need for further work to ascertain how one or more hybrid approaches may also respond more favourably to the 21 SA objectives. As a result of the above, we do not feel that any of the options in isolation would present the most sustainable solution for future development. For example, Option 3 would focus all the housing growth for the 17 year plan period in the form of Strategic Urban Extensions. Whilst as a Practice we support such forms of development in the right locations at the right time, it is clear that a growth strategy which would solely provide for this type of development, proposing growth at only Tier 1 and 2 settlements (Hook, Fleet, Church Crookham, Yateley and Blackwater), would fail to provide for a sufficient choice and range of supply to the housing market on a year by year basis. It would also be likely to raise issues in respect of housing delivery and implications for maintaining a five year housing land supply. As recognised at Paragraph 1.13 of the Full Housing Development Options Paper and also within Table 2.2 of the Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report, which highlights the Key Sustainability Issues and Characteristics within Hart, the District suffers, and has done for some time, from housing affordability issues. The economic recession has certainly had a further impact on this issue as a result of lower completion rates within the District in recent times. However, the issue of worsening housing affordability is not only related to the need for additional supply in terms of delivering sheer numbers, but also with regards to location. Therefore, we would not be supportive of a growth option which would only deliver housing in such limited locations, as we consider that this would lead to the worsening of affordability issues in the other areas of the District. We consider that ignoring this issue would be contrary to the core planning principles within the NPPF which advises that plans should take account of market signals such as land prices and housing affordability, as well as providing for choice and competition. Further to the above, facilities within Hart's smaller settlements may also risk closure during the plan period, without a degree of growth taking place to ensure their vitality. This key issue for Hart is raised at Paragraph 2.33 of the Housing Development Options Consultation Paper, as being an important social issue. Additionally, Table 2.2 of the Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report which has been the subject of public consultation, also considers that the vitality and viability of Hart's town, village and local centres is threatened by the presence of larger centres outside the District and that for rural facilities to remain these will require continued use by local communities. It is clear that in light of an ageing population and with people remaining in their homes for longer, that smaller settlements, particularly those which support local primary schools, will require additional development to support such facilities. It is also clear that if applying a strategy which only seeks to bring forward very large forms of development that potential delays in bringing forward those developments could present significant impacts on the Council's housing land supply. This concern is therefore relevant to Options 3 and 4. From our understanding of the new Local Plan process, the Council and members of the public are exceptionally keen to get a new plan in place which will protect the Council from unplanned forms of development. As such, it is our view that a spatial; housing strategy for Hart District should be varied to ensure as far as possible, regularity and consistency in supply. This would suggest that a range of size and location of sites would be appropriate. Such an approach would also fairly spread both the impacts and associated benefits of development throughout the District. Opportunities for development also vary from settlement to settlement, as recognised by the Housing Development Options Consultation Paper. As such, whilst theoretically looking to develop set growth strategies for consultation, in practice that strategy may not be capable of being delivered in light of the pool of currently available sites. This is demonstrated by Option 2, Dispersal, which for example would not be capable of delivering a consistent 10% growth strategy across the District's tier 1-4 settlements on the basis that the sites are not currently available to deliver the strategy evenly. If this option was pursued, the strategy would either need to be applied flexibly on the basis of the availability of sites or with the plan supporting additional growth to come forward in settlements on currently unidentified sites which may come forward later within the plan period. To be found sound, the plan would nevertheless need to demonstrate that a sufficient supply of identified sites could be delivered in the earlier years of the plan and that settlements with any additional housing figure being applied, would be sufficiently free of constraints to accommodate future growth. In this regard, it is our view that Option 1 would be capable (in combination with Option 2) of supporting and maintaining an appropriate level of housing delivery throughout the District, throughout the plan period. Whilst the actual delivery strategy for Option 2 may not deliver a complete even handed growth, we are not convinced that an arbitrary figure is a necessary element of a dispersal strategy. Indeed, a fair distribution of growth does not necessarily mean an even one, but may be one which has also taken into account specific housing needs and the availability of, or further need for, services and facilities, which are important issues for the District to consider at each settlement. We also consider that some of the development options would risk stagnating good and logical development opportunities which arise during the plan period such as sites which would result in the re-development of brownfield land. It has for a long time been critical for the planning system to support such forms of development in the interests of protecting more sensitive greenfield sites and making efficient use of available land. It is also often the case that such proposals are supported by local communities who wish to see such sites developed, rather than become eyesores or present security issues. As well as potentially failing to make good use of re-development opportunities which may be currently available, we also consider that Options 2, 3, 4, and 5 may fail to address the NPPF's core planning principle which seeks to encourage the effective use of land by reusing land that has been previously developed. This is due to the fact that such opportunities may not necessarily be in locations which could also house a new settlement or be located within or on the edge of settlements which are recognised within a Settlement Hierarchy or have a settlement policy boundary and would therefore not be covered by these options. Supporting these types of development would accord with the main purpose of Option 1 which is to avoid greenfield development and as such could logically be included as part of that option. The strategy should however make clear that opportunities for the re-use of brownfield sites may actually fall outside existing recognised settlements, yet present suitable options for re-development which can be determined on a case by case basis. It is clear that only Option 4 in isolation would be likely to provide sufficient housing to meet the current basic residual requirement at some point in the future. However, even that option has yet to be considered in light of a finalised requirement which provides for (i) sufficient flexibility in supply in case of delayed or non-delivery of sites within the current pipeline, (ii) sufficient flexibility in case of delay or non-delivery of newly allocated sites within the plan itself or (iii) the delivery of any additional housing required to meet unmet need within the HMA. We consider these to be important considerations for the Council when establishing a final requirement for the plan and the strategy through which they will deliver that requirement. In light of the growing levels of concern regarding unplanned developments within the District, we consider it sensible for the emerging Local Plan to ensure that the emerging policies give sufficient direction on the types and location of development which will be deemed acceptable during the plan period. Further, we consider that additional capacity (equating to a 10% buffer) should be built into the plan's allocations or distribution strategy, as this will help the Council and local residents feel that they are retaining control of plan-led development in periods of delayed or non-delivery and allow for the necessary flexibility. In light of the above considerations, we feel that Options 1 and 2 present the most suitable elements on which to base a future growth strategy as part of a hybrid approach. However, we would suggest that Option 1 is amended to provide both a settlement and re-development of brownfield sites focus, to accord with the aims of the NPPF. Whilst predominately supportive of these two options, it is however clear that there may not be sufficient sites under these two options to deliver the level of housing growth required (4,130 - 4,425 dwellings) particularly on the basis that the nature of Option 1 for example, may require more flexibility to be built in with regards to deliverability in terms of the dates with which currently occupied sites may become vacant. Therefore, we also support Option 3 to be included as part of the above hybrid. However we would not agree with the option being the dominant feature of the strategy on the basis that we consider an over-reliance on this option to deliver the majority of development would fail to provide a sufficient supply of housing to meet local needs through its restricted locations. In turn this would be likely to result in worsened housing affordability and in isolation it would fail to meet many of the key sustainability issues and characteristics within Hart, which the plan should be looking to address over the next 17 years. With regards to Options 4 and 5, we do not support the options as the basis on which to focus a growth strategy for the plan period 2011-2021. In respect of Option 4, we consider that there would be significant lead in times for a new settlement in terms of master-planning, land assembly and the delivery of key infrastructure. Given the existing delays which have already taken place in respect of the plan-making process at Hart District and the level of local concern in getting a robust plan in place as soon as possible, we would not support the emerging plan relying solely on the delivery of a new settlement to meet the residual housing requirement, which as the paper suggests may not be capable of delivering homes for 10 years. Whilst theoretically the option provides good sustainability characteristics, it is clear that unless planned for early, there would be likely issues with regards to deliverability. Taking a basic view that housing may not be delivered for the first 10 years of the emerging plan, subsequent delivery would then need to be delivered at 642 dpa for the remaining 7 years of the plan period, in order to deliver its maximum perceived capacity of 4,500 dwellings, which does not seem realistic. Whilst in general we support the theoretical benefits that Option 4 could deliver, we consider that if the Council is minded to support this option, that work should take place during this plan period, to spend the appropriate time on the development of the proposal, including how its future phasing could look, and plan ahead for its delivery within the plan period following 2032.Finally, in respect of Option 5 we do not support the strategy for three key reasons. Firstly, it is clear that in isolation the option would deliver very low levels of housing. Secondly, in isolation, the strategy would also fail to deliver housing throughout the District and would therefore raise many of the issues which Options 3 and 4 in isolation would also present in terms of affordability, impact on existing community facilities etc. However, most importantly, it would locate development a predominately less sustainable area of the District and would be likely to raise substantial landscape issues. Whilst the sustainable settlements of Odiham and North Warnborough also fall within this area and a few villages which have a reasonable level of services, it is clear that there is insufficient capacity to deliver the requirement in these locations alone and that unsustainable locations would therefore be relied upon. Certainly, opportunities to deliver large scale developments would be likely result in significant adverse impacts on the small communities in this part of the District. As the purpose of the option is to focus development away from the SPA zone of influence, yet its potential capacity demonstrates that this would not be possible and that the focus would therefore have to take place elsewhere, we therefore consider the option to be fundamentally flawed as a reasonable alternative growth strategy. This is on the basis that ultimately higher levels of development will need to be provided within the zone of influence than could realistically be achieved outside of it.","q2":"Yes","q2a":"We consider it important for the emerging Local Plan process to fully assess the housing needs of every settlement or hamlet within the District, whilst also reviewing existing provisions and viability of facilities within or within close proximity of these locations. As previously highlighted, we also consider that the plan should provide support for re-development opportunities which arise throughout the District and do not consider that these should be confined to opportunities which fall within existing settlement boundaries. Should appropriate sites be available and there be considered a need for additional housing in the location, then we consider that it would be appropriate for further housing to be supported in such locations. The above issue also raises the need for the Council to carry out a review of its Settlement Hierarchy Paper (January 2010, updated August 2010). As part of this process we consider it critical for the Council to correct the previous exclusion of a settlement policy boundary at Winchfield. Whilst the satellite areas of Winchfield, namely Winchfield Hurst and Winchfield Court are given settlement policy boundaries, the main village area of Winchfield which includes a village pub, village hall and a mainline railway station and has good pedestrian links with Hartley Wintney, is not even mentioned within the Settlement Hierarchy Paper. This is a significant error, given the level of sustainability the settlement has by virtue of the station. As a result, when considered in conjunction with the current hierarchy we feel that the main settlement area of Winchfield which surrounds the station, must be identified as a Tier 4 main village. We consider that correcting this error now is important, particularly with the location providing a potential long term option for future growth, as outlined within our response to Question 3 below. Additionally, when reviewing the Settlement Hierarchy for the District as part of the current Local Plan process, we would support the previous recognition made by the previous Draft Core Strategy in respect of development opportunities which exist at existing ‘clusters of development', not just defined settlements. Such forms of development are very common within Hart District and must be recognised by the emerging Local Plan as providing further potential for development.","q3":"We have already provided brief comments on Option 4 within our response to Question 1 and consider the option to be inappropriate for the current plan. However in response to this question we can provide the following views. With regards to location, we consider that there are very few opportunities within Hart to sustainably deliver a new settlement. When looking at the former patterns of growth within the District, it is clear that proximity to rail, the M3 and A30 are important characteristics and drivers for development, as these ultimately provide strong commuter links for future residents, as well as good connections to larger hubs where further facilities can be accessed. Further, it is clear that if a new settlement is to provide reasonable levels of employment floorspace, that it should also be easily accessed by a potential workforce, which may not necessarily also live at the new settlement. In light of these issues, we consider that there are a few possible locations for providing a new settlement within Hart District. For example, land to the south of Junction 5 of the M3 would present a possible location for a new settlement. It would benefit from direct access to the M3 whilst also being sustainably located close to existing facilities at North Warnborough and Odiham, which includes a secondary school. Meanwhile it would also be close to Hook, which provides further facilities, employment opportunities and services including a mainline railway station. The new settlement itself could also provide for additional facilities to enhance the overall provision in this area. A further location which has been historically discussed as a suitable location for providing this form of development is Winchfield. This also presents a logical location for major development on the basis that it has the right credentials to play a social, economic and environmental role. Whilst we consider that there is also a very realistic opportunity for significant growth at Winchfield, we nevertheless consider that the option would present major deliverability issues for this plan period. At a result of these, it could not be an option which could be realistically supported in isolation to deliver the Council's current residual level of housing need, which may yet increase further. As established in our response to Question 1, the resulting delivery rates would be exceptionally high and ultimately the plan would fail to deliver within the outlined period. It could however logically provide a long term solution for the District, which in a future plan would alleviate pressures on existing settlements which already feel that they are being expected to provide for higher levels of development due to constraints experienced at other settlements and for which they feel they do not have appropriate levels of facilities to support. The concept of a new settlement would reduce these pressures, but would require sufficient planning to ensure that the settlement worked in terms of self-sufficiency by ensuring that it delivered essential infrastructure early on and did not add to existing problems elsewhere. It is therefore considered that a new settlement proposal would require a substantial amount of time to fully consider and develop. Such a process should not be rushed. A commitment to this future work could however be outlined within the emerging Local Plan, although we do not consider that any reliance should be placed on the proposal delivering until the next plan period. By committing to this work early, it would however help to provide a seamless transition into the plan period post 2032. With regard to how large a new settlement should be, we consider that this will ultimately be determined by the availability of land, the landscape characteristics at that location, the land-take required for appropriate infrastructure and through appropriate master-planning work to establish developable areas and appropriate densities associated with each of those. In order to ensure self-sufficiency and taking into account pressures experienced elsewhere, it would appear essential for the new settlement to provide for new education facilities including secondary. Clearly in order to deliver such facilities, it would be necessary for the proposal to be of a reasonable scale to support them. However, until such work has been carried out we do not consider that it would be possible to justify a specific figure at this stage. Indeed, if Winchfield is the option the Council is considering, we consider that there are a wide number of issues to be addressed in association with the location, including whether it would be appropriate or indeed viable in highways terms to secure a further junction from the M3 adjacent to the location and how far development should extend eastwards and southwards, etc. It is considered that such issues will take a significant amount of time to consider and take through public consultation exercises. The location also needs to be assessed in conjunction with any alternative options. Alternatives may also include the expansions of existing sustainably located clusters of development into new villages or where opportunities may exist for a combination of smaller new settlements to be created or extended.","q4":"Yes","q4a":"As outlined above, we consider that a hybrid option would deliver the most benefits for Hart. A combination of Option 1 (combined with a re-development focus) and Option 2 aimed at delivering the majority of the District's objectively assessed needs is considered to be the most appropriate approach. However, as previously outlined, we have concerns regarding the need for the plan to build in a degree of flexibility and that Options 1 and 2 combined may be unlikely to deliver sufficient housing alone without a further injection from another option. In this respect, we consider that a lower provision sought through Option 3 later in the plan period, would be capable of meeting any gap caused by any non-delivery under Options 1 and 2, any non-delivery within existing sources of supply and any unmet need elsewhere in the HMA. Without building in sufficient flexibility in the numbers from the outset, we consider that it will be difficult to do so later in the plan-making process if changes in supply and need arise. Whilst the public may be concerned with additional capacity being allocated within the plan, we nevertheless consider that it would in fact provide greater certainty and control over the development process for communities, by having the flexibility to release sites which have been the subject of public consultation. Furthermore, we consider that the variety in location, scale and types of site that a hybrid option would provide for, will help to maintain deliverability within Hart, as the market will undoubtedly move through different patterns of development demand during the 17 year plan period. We also consider that Option 3 ‘focussed growth' through urban extensions, if being considered as part of a hybrid option rather than in isolation (and thus being required to deliver less development), should also consider the expansion of existing Tier 4 and 5 villages or the expansion of existing sustainably located clusters of existing development into new villages. At present, we consider that Option 3 is significantly constrained by only considering large extensions to Tier 1 and 2 settlements and that Option 2 which would support development adjacent to existing settlements only relates to Tier 1-4 settlements. As our response to this consultation has highlighted, we consider that there are sufficient options available within Hart to meet their full objectively assessed housing needs. Whilst we are aware of the recent changes published by Government in the NPPG in respect of whether housing and economic needs override constraints on the use of land, such as sites protected under the Birds and Habitats Directives etc, we consider that there is sufficient scope within Hart to both avoid and mitigate effects on the SPA. Therefore we do not consider that the adverse impacts of meeting the full objectively assessed housing needs would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole. As we have already covered, there are numerous settlements within Hart which fall outside of the SPA's 5km zone of influence altogether (North Warnborough, Odiham, South Warnborough, Long Sutton, etc). Meanwhile, there are also sufficient opportunities within the District which can deliver on-site mitigation through SANGs, in addition to other opportunities which exist for the creation of new strategic SANGs both of which are appropriate for mitigation against the recreational impacts of new development within its catchment (in addition to SAMM measures). We are aware that the Council is currently waiting on the findings of new evidence it has commissioned to establish whether SANGs and SAMM measures are working and whether there is evidence to support an overall cap on new housing within 5km of the SPA. We note that the results of this information had been anticipated ahead of the current consultation and consider that this would have been helpful to aid responses to the options. However, from our experience of SPAs elsewhere, our understanding is that such mitigation measures do tend to prove effective. Therefore should the results of the study confirm this to be the case within Hart, proximity to the SPA should not constitute a reason to reduce housing delivery below the levels required to meet the full objectively assessed housing needs of the District, as appropriate mitigation solutions are available. As such there would not be any resulting adverse impacts of development, after a combination of avoidance and mitigation measures are applied, that would be significant enough to outweigh the benefits of new housing and employment.","q5":"We do not have many further comments to make on the Housing Development Options Paper or the Sustainability Appraisal and in general, we support the work which has been undertaken for this stage. We would however support the addition of a further phase of consultation taking place ahead of a Draft Plan. This could give further consideration to the level of requirement that would be appropriate for the plan to allocate sufficient sites or distribute housing requirements for and more importantly, allow the public to comment on a selection of hybrids and even identify potential housing allocations to help inform the Draft Plan. It is clear from our review of the options that a hybrid approach will ultimately be required in order to produce a plan which is deliverable. Public buy-in to that decision will be important. Given the level of work carried out for the current public consultation, we do not consider that a subsequent consultation, informed by the feedback of this consultation, would involve significant work or that it would lead to a delay in the current timetable. On a separate issue we also consider it important for the Council to quickly establish how new development will be delivered via the plan process and when that plan may start to deliver. We consider that this is currently unclear, with the Council highlighting at Paragraph 5.3 of the Housing Development Options Consultation paper that they are retaining an open mind as to the most appropriate planning document to prepare. We agree that until a housing strategy is established it is difficult to determine the level of detail which could be included within the emerging Local Plan, however we have some concern that the indication is that the Local Plan itself may not seek to make many or possibly any allocations. With regards to the Council's views at Paragraph 5.14 that preparing a separate site allocations document rather than producing a comprehensive local plan will result in a reduction in detail and time required for getting the first plan adopted, we raise a degree of scepticism that this is correct and also the right approach for Hart District. Whilst it is considered likely that the main Local Plan will be quicker to produce without allocations, we remain unconvinced that overall the process of producing two separate plans will be shorter than producing a single plan. Additionally, it will still be necessary to demonstrate at Examination that the strategic policies, including those on housing are in fact deliverable, which will ultimately require some assessment of sites to take place. Whilst decisions regarding site specific proposals can be deferred to the production of the allocations plan, they will still nevertheless be required to be made and until such time as both plans are in place, the Council will remain at risk from unplanned development.We therefore feel that further consideration should be given to the content of the emerging Local Plan to establish how it can contribute effectively to meeting housing requirements in the short term and could also address any delays which may occur in the production of the subsequent allocations plan. We are not sure on the potential timescales for the adoption of an allocations plan, but expect that this would be likely to extend beyond August 2017, which the LDS Third Revision April 2014 anticipated for the adoption of a Development Management Policies DPD. Furthermore, we are aware that there is growing interest within local communities in Neighbourhood Planning. This will potentially have a further impact on the plan, if a number of communities are likely to progress with plans which may advance ahead of the District's Local Plan and subsequent allocations plan. If the Council remains minded not to progress with a full Local Plan the issues above may suggest that it would be most sensible to allocate medium to large sites considered to meet the strategic approach to be agreed, whilst providing a distribution strategy for the remaining figures at other settlements, which would then either be allocated through Neighbourhood Plans or a subsequent site allocations document allocating smaller sites. This approach would at least ensure that there are some allocated sites in the pipeline at the earliest opportunity, whilst also evidencing at Examination that the Council can demonstrate that the Local Plan's proposed strategy will be capable of delivering an appropriate housing land supply throughout the plan period.","i":600},

{"r":[2,3,5,1,2],"q1":"For a long time, Fleet and Church Crookham have suffered considerable growth without sufficient improvement in infrastructure in order to maintain the amenity of residents and users of the towns. The infrastructure has been widespread ranging from traffic congestion, shortage of school places, lack of capacity at healthcare facilities, as well as overburdened drainage system, and increased environmental pressure on the greenspaces and SPA areas. It is clear to us that a comprehensive plan is urgently required that will not only deliver appropriate growth that is demanded, but essentially provide an infrastructure network that is able to keep pace with such growth. The New Settlement option seems to be the obvious solution to long term growth and infrastructure needs in a properly planned and sustainable manner. We have therefore rated that as our number 1 preferred option. In comparison, the Urban Extension option dumps large concentrations of growth on the most already overburdened areas. In our experience, developers often attempt to ‘piggy-back' existing infrastructure in order to minimise their costs. The problem of course, is that there is limited or no additional capacity within the existing systems and the amenity of residents is adversely affected. We have therefore rated this as our least preferred option, ranking it 5.Clearly, the problem with the New Settlement option is the amount of time before it is capable of delivering housing. We are very concern over the lack of clarity as to how many dwellings will need to be delivered from across the other options before a new settlement is capable of delivering appropriate numbers of housing. From our estimation, it looks possible that half of the 4000 new permissions will need to be found from elsewhere within the current planning period. It seems likely, therefore, that half the numbers promised by a new settlement are relevant to a subsequent planning period rather than this one. It would have been more sensible for Hart to have indicated approximately how many of the ‘4000 homes or more' it felt was possible to be delivered within the subject planning period (as it is only those numbers which are relevant to this consultation) so as to provide consultees an indication of the numbers that are likely to be required from the other options.Assuming a large quantity still needs to be found from the other options, options 1 and 5 clearly have the least impact over the already overburdened Fleet and Church Crookham areas. We have therefore ranked them equally as preference 2. The obvious danger with these options is that small scale developments are constrained in providing noticeable infrastructure, mainly as the geographic area is scattered and infrastructure improvement is more likely to be distanced from the new housing. It seems therefore that only option 2 (by default) would be capable of satisfying a large shortfall of dwellings prior to a New Settlement being capable of delivering. We have a huge reservation with this option as it is most comparable to the ad hoc development that the area has experienced in recent years and has given rise to either unsuitable developments or major shortfalls in services and amenity. Should this option be chosen to supplement option 4, then it is essential that a robust plan is put in place to deliver infrastructure to keep pace with increased housing numbers","q2":"Yes","q2a":"The Local Plan has to demonstrate that it is capable of delivering a large number of houses to meet demand. This has to balance the needs of many residents that feel recent growth has already been excessive and those which are finding it difficult to find suitable (or affordable) housing. The housing needs are not limited to any one area or groups of areas, so it follows that there would also be housing needs within even the smallest settlements. Even the smallest settlements should therefore accept some housing in order to satisfy their local needs and that of Hart more generally. Clearly, the extent of new housing in these areas should be within the context of their settlement size and able to be supported by the available infrastructure.","q3":"There has been much talk and media coverage about a suggested site for a new settlement that would be categorised as Option 4. The remit of the Fleet & Church Crookham Society relates to these towns and whilst, of course, we are very aware of the general planning situation in the rest of Hart, we do not have an intimate knowledge of the needs of other neighbouring communities within the district. It would therefore not be appropriate to promote specific sites.That said, our principle concern relating to housing growth consistently focuses on the ability to deliver infrastructure needs. Whilst it is physically possible to build new schools, medical facilities etc, often it is the transport and highways infrastructure that is most constrained from being capable of improvement. Clearly in the selection process of possible new settlement sites, we feel that it is essential that such candidates should have easy access to major road and rail networks and be capable for future expansion to meet the needs of subsequent planning periods.","q4":"-","q4a":"Encouragement should be provided to land owners and developers to promote suitable sites that can accommodate additional housing within areas that are able to preserve or enhance infrastructure for existing and new inhabitants.","q5":"Special Protection Area. The importance and legal obligations relating to the protection of the SPA areas are significant. Recent planning consents have been granted on the assumption that the SANGS provision delivers adequate mitigation against pressures that new housing applies to the SPA. We are very concerned that the mitigation measures provided are very much unproven and of questionable effectiveness. As such, we feel the mitigation measures fall short of the legal requirements and render the SPA areas at risk. The emerging Local Plan will need to address this issue very carefully to ensure the SPA areas are properly preserved. We feel strongly that the SANGS areas, if proven effective should be used only in support of mitigation for development within Hart.Infrastructure. For many years Fleet & Church Crookham has taken the brunt of the burden that additional housing brings and has suffered greatly as a result of the time lag in delivering improvements in infrastructure. Often contributions towards infrastructure through the Section 106 mechanism disappears outside the district or is delivered much later than the housing itself. With the advent of the Community Infrastructure Levy we are greatly concerned that there will be a disconnect between the developer funding and the extent of tangible benefit delivered. We therefore urge that the Local Plan contains robust measures to ensure that tangible local improvements are delivered in time to keep pace with the housing burden.Neighbouring authority housing needs Largely due to circumstance, Hart's neighbouring authorities have had approved Local Plans in place for a number of years. These plans were constructed and approved on the basis of, what is now, historical data in terms of wider area housing needs. Since then, housing needs have increased whilst the numbers contained within their Local Plans have remained constant. Current planning policy requires Hart to consider the wider area housing needs which will presumably include any shortfall between local authority's current housing needs and the housing needs calculated at the time of their Local Plans. We are very concerned that there may be pressure on Hart to take greater housing numbers to the timing differences in neighbouring authorities local plans. We would therefore urge clarity of these numbers and a mechanism in place for neighbouring authorities to realign their delivery plans in relation to recent housing needs data.We note that Hart is open to very considerable developer pressure by not currently having an approved Local Plan in place, a point reinforced by the Housing Minister at a recent public presentation in Fleet. We therefore urge Hart to take up every opportunity to prepare the Local Plan within the earliest possible timescales.","i":613},
